  "1 \nDear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners: \nFiscal year 2024 was a pivotal year for Microsoft. We entered our 50th year as a company and the second year of the AI \nplatform shift. With these milestones, I’ve found myself reflecting on how Microsoft has remained a consequential company \ndecade after decade in an industry with no franchise value. And I realize that it’s because—time and time again, when tech \nparadigms have shifted—we have seized the opportunity to reinvent ourselves to stay relevant to our customers, our \npartners, and our employees. And that’s what we are doing again today.  \nMicrosoft has been a platform and tools company from the start. We were founded in 1975 with a belief in creating \ntechnology that would enable others to create their own. And, nearly 50 years later, this belief remains at the heart of our \nmission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.",
  "mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.  \nThis year, we moved from talking about AI to helping our customers translate it into real outcomes—one person, one \norganization, one institution, and one country at a time. We have made remarkable progress on this front across every \nindustry. For example:  \n• \nColes is generating 1.6 billion daily AI predictions across 850 Australian stores, ensuring every shopper finds \nwhat they need.  \n• \nUnilever is performing thousands of simulations with AI in the time it would take to run tens of laboratory \nexperiments, as it accelerates its product development.  \n• \nDevelopers at Itaú, Brazil’s largest private bank, are coding more efficiently using our AI pair programmer, \nGitHub Copilot.  \n• \nKhan Academy is making tutoring more accessible for students and helping teachers plan more creative \nlessons, using our small language model Phi.  \n•",
  "GitHub Copilot.  \n• \nKhan Academy is making tutoring more accessible for students and helping teachers plan more creative \nlessons, using our small language model Phi.  \n• \nAquafarmers in Indonesia are improving their yields, thanks to an app built with the Azure OpenAI Service, as \nwell as Azure IoT.  \n• \nIn Kenya, street vendors now have access to credit for the first time, thanks to M-Kopa, a social enterprise \nusing Azure ML to do its forecasting.  \n• \nAnd enterprise customers and their employees around the world, from Amgen and Disney, to Finastra and \nVodafone, are using Microsoft 365 Copilot to become more creative and productive.  \nFinancially, the year was also marked by record performance. We delivered over $245 billion in annual revenue, up \n16 percent year-over-year, and over $109 billion in operating income, up 24 percent.  \nGoing forward, we are focused on three priorities: First, prioritizing fundamentals, with security above all else.

  "Going forward, we are focused on three priorities: First, prioritizing fundamentals, with security above all else. We launched \nthe Secure Future Initiative (SFI) this year, bringing together every part of our organization to advance cybersecurity \nprotection. Second, driving trustworthy AI innovation across our entire portfolio while continuing to scale our cloud business. \nAnd, finally, managing our cost structure dynamically to generate durable, long-term operating leverage. All three priorities \nare critical to our ability to continue thriving as a company as we raise the bar on our operational excellence, with a focus \non continuous improvement across everything we do.  \nAGE OF AI  \nIf we go back 70 years to the beginning of modern computing, our industry has had two dreams: First, can computers \nunderstand us instead of us having to understand computers?

  "understand us instead of us having to understand computers? And second, as we digitize more of the world—including \npeople, places, and things—can computers help us reason, plan, and act more effectively using all that information? Over \nthe past year, we have had breakthroughs on both fronts.  \nThe core underlying force behind these breakthroughs is scaling laws. Just like Moore’s Law drove the information \nrevolution, the scaling laws of deep neural networks (DNN) and transformers are driving today’s AI revolution. Up until the \nDNN inflection point, progress in compute was keeping up with Moore’s Law—doubling every two years. But we have now \nstarted to see progress in AI performance double roughly every six months.  \n  \nThere are three capabilities coming together because of these scaling laws. First, we have a new natural user interface that \nis multimodal. It supports speech, images, and videos—both as input and output. We have memory that retains important",
  "is multimodal. It supports speech, images, and videos—both as input and output. We have memory that retains important \ncontext, recalling both our personal knowledge and data across devices, apps, and the web. And, finally, we have new \n \n2 \nreasoning and planning capabilities that help us understand complex context, complete end-to-end tasks on our behalf, and \nreduce our cognitive load.  \nThis new world is being defined by a rich tapestry of AI agents, which can take action on our behalf, including personal \nagents across work and life, business process agents, and cross-organizational ones. These agents will be able to work in \nconcert as a new input to help make small businesses more productive, make multinationals more competitive, make the \npublic sector more efficient, and improve health and education outcomes broadly.  \nMicrosoft has built three leading platforms to help our customers maximize their opportunity in this emerging agentic era:",
  "Microsoft has built three leading platforms to help our customers maximize their opportunity in this emerging agentic era: \nCopilot, which you can think of as the new UI for AI—the human interface for this agentic world; the Copilot stack, which \nbrings together infrastructure, data, and app services to help customers build their own copilots and agents for their own \nbusiness processes; and a new category of Copilot devices that are purpose-built for this new era, including the Copilot+ \nPCs we introduced this year.  \nOUR OPPORTUNITY  \nThe innovation we have driven over the past year matters only if we translate it into enduring value for our customers. That’s \nwhy, across our tech stack, we are focused on helping people and organizations realize the benefits of AI.  \nInfrastructure  \nThis year, we expanded our cloud and AI capacity, announcing new investments across five continents.

  "Infrastructure  \nThis year, we expanded our cloud and AI capacity, announcing new investments across five continents. These are long-\nterm assets to drive new growth for the next decade and beyond, and ensure communities around the world have access \nto the compute they need to drive economic growth in this new era.  \nOur cloud now also offers top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, \nincluding the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia, which we introduced last \nNovember.  \nMore broadly, we continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations as customers turn to Azure. Azure Arc is \nhelping customers streamline their transition, as they secure, develop, and operate workloads with Azure services \nanywhere. We have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90 percent year-over-year. And we remain the hyperscale cloud of choice \nfor SAP and Oracle workloads.  \nData & AI",

If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the \nsecurity before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income \n(expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions \ndeteriorate, we may incur future impairments.",
  "(expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions \ndeteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  \nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment \nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a \nqualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the \namount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other \nincome (expense), net.  \nGoodwill  \nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We \nevaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation",
  "evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation \napproach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating \nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would \nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could \ninclude a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or \ndisposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  \nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of \nassets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each",
  "assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each \nreporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow \nmethodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on \ninternal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash \nflows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  \nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, \nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination \nof fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  \n \n40 \nResearch and Development Costs",
  "of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  \n \n40 \nResearch and Development Costs  \nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until \ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs \nare capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when \ntechnological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software \nproducts is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this \noccurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue \nover the estimated life of the products.  \n  \nLegal and Other Contingencies",
  "over the estimated life of the products.  \n  \nLegal and Other Contingencies    \nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss \nfrom a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset \nhas been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining \nwhether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome \nand the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our \nconsolidated financial statements.  \nIncome Taxes  \nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current \nyear, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an",

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely \nthan not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the \nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest \nbenefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides \nguidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, \naccounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.

Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial \nstatements.  \nBusiness Combinations – Valuation of Intangible Assets  \nAccounting for business combinations requires significant judgments when allocating the purchase price to the estimated \nfair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Determination of fair value involves estimates \nand assumptions which can be complex, most notably with respect to intangible assets.

Due to investments in \nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.  \nForeign Currencies  \nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.

We enter into contracts that can include \nvarious combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate \nperformance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, \nwhich are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  \nNature of Products and Services  \nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available \nto the customer.

Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the \nsame functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from \ndistinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. \nIn cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional \ncharge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related \ndevice or license.  \nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software \nAssurance (“SA”).

Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract \nperiod as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance \nobligations that are satisfied over time.  \nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the \nsoftware, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \nsubscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \nconsumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such \nresources.

Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are \nprovided.  \nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function \nwithout the operating system.

Determining \nwhether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \nversus together may require significant judgment.

Revenue from \nOffice 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  \n  \nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate \nSSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no \n \n50 \nadditional charge.

We typically have \nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers \nand circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in \ndetermining the SSP.  \nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances",

Changes to our estimated variable \nconsideration were not material for the periods presented.  \nContract Balances and Other Receivables  \nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers.

Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year \nagreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting \nservices to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-\ndelivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the \nrevenue when we transfer control of the product or service.",

In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing \nfrom our customers or to provide customers with financing.

For software warranties, we estimate \nthe costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our \nestimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \nResearch and Development  \nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other \nheadcount-related expenses associated with product development.

In general, investments with \noriginal maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term \ninvestments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature \nand because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  \nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific \nidentification method.

To determine \n \n53 \ncredit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In \naddition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee.

If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future \nimpairments.  \nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily \ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable \nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a \nperiodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than \ncarrying value.

We have determined we \nare not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments are not consolidated and the \nmajority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  \nDerivatives  \nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.

Where applicable, these models \nproject future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable \ninputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for \ncurrencies.

Our lease terms may include options to extend or \nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is \nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  \nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain \nequipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.",
  "equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \nAdditionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU \nassets and liabilities.  \nGoodwill  \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) \non an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely \nthan not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  \n \n55 \nIntangible Assets  \nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the \neconomic benefits received.

We assumed responsibility \nfor these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the \nNokia defendants. Twelve of these cases were consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are \nstayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims",
  "stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims \narising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency \nemission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either \noperated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also \nallege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  \nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on \nthe basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion \nto exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia",
  "to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia \nCourt of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals \nissued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further \nproceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by \nthe court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ \nmotion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of \nplaintiffs’ experts from testifying. The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal of the consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to",

Plaintiffs appealed the court’s order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their \nbriefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the stayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, the court \nentered summary judgment in nine of the stayed cases on the grounds that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by the general \ncausation outcome in the consolidated cases.  \nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter  \nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether \nLinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection \nRegulation (“GDPR”).
