    "text": "Introduction\n2023 Year in Review\nGoals Summary\nHow We Work\nCSO Letter\nA Letter from \nOur Chief \nSustainability \nOfficer\nAt Amazon, we are always looking for ways to move faster, \ndeliver the best possible customer experience, and innovate. \nWe regularly hear from our customers, corporate partners, \nand employees how much they care about sustainability and \nsocial responsibility. For a company as diverse as Amazon, \nembedding these values into all of our businesses, products, \nand services—as well as how we deliver for our customers—\nhas been an incredible undertaking, with much of it taking \nplace behind-the-scenes. \nProgress is likely easiest to spot in our Stores business. \nOur customers let us know that their Amazon packages are \nnow arriving at their doorsteps faster, with less packaging, \nand delivered by more electric delivery vehicles than ever \nbefore. By regionalizing our operations and transportation \nnetworks in the U.S., we can now deliver items faster and \nat lower costs. This also allows us to minimize or avoid \nextra packaging altogether, while reducing the distance a \npackage has to travel, cutting back on the carbon emissions \nassociated with deliveries. \nWe also know our customers look to Amazon to be a leader \namong our peers. On renewable energy, we set an ambitious \ngoal to match 100% of the electricity consumed by our \nglobal operations with renewable energy by 2030, and \nwe reached that goal in 2023—seven years early. As we \nlook to the future, we are steadfast in our Climate Pledge \ncommitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations \nby 2040. We will continue to lead and invest in creating \ncarbon-free energy around the world at scale, including \nthrough solar, wind, nuclear, and other emerging energy \ntechnologies. Our progress toward a net-zero carbon \nbusiness will not be linear, and each year as our various \nbusinesses grow and evolve, we will produce different \nresults. These results will be influenced by significant \nchanges to our business, investments in growth, and \nmeeting the needs of our customers. Through it all, we will \nremain steadfast as we invent, adapt, and will our way to \nmeeting our commitment to The Climate Pledge.   \nWe know that driving change means staying focused on \nbringing entire industries along with us. Over the past five \nyears, we’ve done this by encouraging companies to join \nThe Climate Pledge—and we’re proud that over 500 have \njoined us and committed to be net-zero carbon 10 years \nahead of the Paris Agreement. But we wanted to do more. \nMost recently, our sustainability team has been developing \nresources to share our expertise and help our suppliers build, \nmeasure, and act on their sustainability commitments. That’s \nwhy we’ve launched the Amazon Sustainability Exchange, a \nfree sustainability resource center that contains a number of \nAmazon’s previously proprietary playbooks, templates, case \nstudies, and science models, among other sustainability best \npractices. \nLooking ahead, we know our customers look to us to be \nat the cutting edge of new and growing technologies and \nenable them for good. We’re already deploying artificial \nintelligence (AI) in ways that benefit our customers directly, \nsuch as using it to right-size packaging and avoid waste. \nWe’re exploring a growing number of AI applications—\nwhether it’s monitoring and optimizing our energy use \nor helping combat deforestation in Brazil. We also see an \nopportunity to use AI to address sustainability challenges at \nan unprecedented scale, all while delivering new solutions \nfor our customers. Much work remains, and we’re excited \nthat Amazon is uniquely positioned to figure out how AI \ncan help us address climate change in a more efficient and \nresponsible way.\nMost importantly, we need to continue to invest in talent and \nhire employees who can lead on sustainability. We’re proud \nof the wide range of sustainability-focused career paths we \noffer at Amazon, including engineers, scientists, content \ncreators, building architects, and more. And for those whose \njobs aren’t directly within a sustainability field, we offer \nupskilling programs and affinity groups where our employees \ncan learn more and get involved. It’s thanks to the thousands \nof professionals working behind-the-scenes across Amazon \nthat we are able to bring all of this amazing work to life. \nI’m proud of the work that’s underway, and truly excited \nfor what’s to come. \nWith gratitude,\nKara Hurst \nChief Sustainability Officer\nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\n4\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nValue Chain",

    "text": "Watch \n how we embed sustainability initiatives throughout all aspects of our business.\nOur Approach\nAt Amazon, we think long term, take on grand challenges, \nand invent solutions to complex problems. These are some \nof the reasons we co-founded and committed to The Climate \nPledge in 2019—our goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions \nby 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement—and have \ninvited hundreds of companies to join us.\nAmazon has a variety of businesses touching many sectors, \nsome of which rely on carbon-intensive industries to provide \ncritical goods and services to our customers. However, we \nbelieve the complexity of our business puts us in a unique \nposition to be a leader in decarbonization strategies. We \nhave an opportunity to demonstrate how achieving net-\nzero carbon emissions is possible across many sectors, while \ncreating solutions that benefit our business as well as the \nindustries in which we operate. \nFoundationally, our strategy relies on embedding \ndecarbonization initiatives and efficiency improvements \nacross our business. Our comprehensive approach to \nreducing and avoiding carbon emissions focuses on key \nsectors of our business, including delivery and logistics; \nbuilding construction and operations; servers and hardware; \ngrocery, products, and devices; and packaging. Teams across \nAmazon are accountable for setting decarbonization plans \nthat map back to Amazon’s worldwide strategy because \nownership and accountability are critical to operational \nsuccess and managing complexity. We focus on four \ncrosscutting initiatives to decarbonize our business: \n•\t We focus first on driving efficiency across our \noperations to reduce and avoid emissions at scale. This \nincludes improving transportation routing, increasing \npack and fill rates, improving cloud-computing chip \nefficiency, adding Low Power Mode to devices, and \ninstalling energy-efficient lighting and HVAC solutions \nin buildings. \n•\t We select lower-carbon alternatives, such as lower-\ncarbon concrete and steel in construction, and lower-\nemission fuels and vehicles in transportation. We use \nthese alternatives where possible, based on a number of \nfactors including cost, emissions reduction potential, and \navailability.\n•\t We’re transitioning toward carbon-free electricity, \ninvesting in renewables—rooftop solar installations \non our buildings, and new, utility-scale wind and solar \nprojects—as well as other carbon-free electricity sources, \nsuch as nuclear. \n•\t We engage with suppliers to help reduce emissions from \nactivities beyond our direct operations. We encourage \nthem to set credible decarbonization goals, publicly share \nprogress, and implement carbon reduction strategies \nthroughout their operations and supply chains —and \nwe are providing support to help our supply chain \ntake action.1 \nIn addition to decarbonizing our own business, we are helping \ndrive progress across industries. To do this, we focus on \nthree accelerators:  \n•\t We invest in breakthrough technology by adopting \nready-to-scale solutions, as well as evaluating and \ninvesting in emerging technologies that can help address \nemissions from hard-to-abate sectors including aviation, \nshipping, and building construction. Through direct \nfunding, we aim to advance our own progress toward \nnet-zero carbon emissions and help accelerate the \nwidespread adoption of new technologies by making \nthem more affordable and accessible. \n•\t We support policies that drive decarbonization. \nAmazon works with policymakers, governments, \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), industry \nassociations, coalitions, and other partners on numerous \nregulatory and policy issues. We seek to advance and \nincentivize decarbonization by supporting policies \nthat scale lower-emission fuels, drive lower-emission \nvehicle deployment and infrastructure, advance the \ndeployment of carbon-free energy, modernize the grid, \nand accelerate investments in clean technologies.\n•\t We catalyze industry action. Through The Climate \nPledge, Amazon brings together companies from \naround the world to drive collective action, cross-\nsector collaboration, and engagement in initiatives that \nencourage industry action toward decarbonization.\nIn parallel to reducing and avoiding emissions throughout \nour business, we are also investing in carbon neutralization \nthrough additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and \nsocially beneficial offsets. As part of this effort, we are \nengaging in science-led collaborations to build credible \nneutralization initiatives that can be deployed at scale in \nthe future. \n10\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWater\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon",

    "text": "Our Progress\nAmazon’s Carbon Footprint\nIn 2023, our absolute carbon emissions decreased by 3%.2  \nThis overall decrease was driven by an 11% reduction in \nemissions from electricity (Scope 2) and a 5% decrease in \nindirect and supply chain emissions (Scope 3). We had a 7% \nincrease in emissions from our direct operations (Scope 1),  \nprimarily from the use of transportation fuels. Our carbon \nintensity decreased for the fifth consecutive year, down 13% \nfrom 2022 to 2023.3 This metric demonstrates how we are \nworking to decouple emissions growth from business growth. \nEvery year, we aim to serve our customers better, more \nquickly, and with fewer emissions, but we know our progress \nmay not be linear as our business continues to grow. In 2023, \nwe invested in carbon abatement projects across Amazon. \nWe continue to invent, think long term, and place big bets \nto accelerate decarbonization efforts year over year. In \naddition to our direct investment and work to decarbonize \nour business, we also worked with organizations throughout \nour supply chain and broader industry to reduce and avoid \nemissions and create solutions to help decarbonize our \nvalue chain. Annually, we also improve our science and \ndata-driven approach to track and measure decarbonization \nacross Amazon.\nScope 1: Direct Emissions and Operations\nAmazon’s Scope 1 emissions are primarily generated from \nthe fuel used by our transportation and logistics fleet to \ndeliver packages to customers. In 2023, our Scope 1 emissions \nincreased 7% compared to 2022 and represented 21% of our \ntotal carbon footprint.

    "text": "In 2023, our net sales grew 12% and more than two-thirds of \nAmazon packages were delivered via Amazon’s own logistics \nnetwork. We decreased emissions per package through \noperational efficiencies, such as improving truck fill rates \n(the percentage of truck volume that is utilized), shipping \nproducts in their own packaging without additional Amazon \npackaging, and using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize \npackaging types. For example, Amazon data scientists trained \nan AI model to understand a variety of product attributes, \nincluding an item’s shape and durability, and to analyze \ncustomer feedback on how different packaging options have \nperformed. The model is constantly learning and has helped \nreduce our use of packaging material since it launched \nin 2019. \nWe strive to keep our packaging lightweight and minimal, \nwhile ensuring products reach customers without damage. \nLighter, more flexible, and right-sized packaging helps reduce \ndelivery emissions per package by using less material and \ntaking up less space in delivery vehicles. Since 2015, we have \nreduced the average per-shipment packaging weight by 43% \nand avoided more than 3 million metric tons of packaging, \nincluding more than 446,000 metric tons in 2023 alone.4 \nGlobally, we shipped 12% of products in their own packaging \nin 2023. This provides a better customer experience by \nminimizing the packaging materials used for delivery, \nand avoids incremental carbon emissions associated with \nadditional materials and weight. \nLearn more about how we’re improving packaging \nAs the number of products we deliver has continued to \nincrease, we aim to keep improving the efficiency of the \nroutes our trucks drive. For example, to get packages to \ncustomers faster and with fewer emissions, we reorganized \nour U.S. transportation network from one national network \nto eight strategic regions in 2023. Regionalization helped \nus avoid driving nearly 16 million miles last year. We also \nprioritized shipping products by lower-carbon train and sea \nroutes—instead of trucking—for middle mile deliveries in \nEurope. We are excited to invest in technologies today that \nwill help reduce our footprint in the future, such as scaling \nup our use of electric vehicles (EVs) and other lower-carbon \nvehicles to decrease our Scope 1 emissions.\nScope 2: Indirect Emissions from \nPurchased Electricity\nOur Scope 2 emissions are from electricity used to power \nAmazon’s buildings, including data centers, office buildings, \nfulfillment centers, and grocery stores, and to charge EVs \nat our facilities. In 2023, our Scope 2 emissions decreased \nby 11% compared to 2022 and represented 4% of our total \ncarbon footprint. This decrease resulted from our increased \nuse of electricity from renewable sources, such as wind \nand onsite solar, as well as from purchasing additional \nenvironmental attributes (such as renewable energy credits) \nto signal our support for renewable energy in the grids where \nwe operate, in line with the expected generation of the \nprojects we have contracted.\nIn 2023, we are proud to have achieved our goal to match \n100% of the electricity consumed by our global operations \nwith renewable energy—seven years ahead of our original \n2030 goal. This achievement was driven by scaling up our \nportfolio of renewable energy projects. Our journey has \nincluded enabling major solar, wind, and battery storage \nprojects around the world, including the first wind farm \nin Mississippi, and becoming the first corporate purchaser \nto invest in renewable energy projects in countries such as \nIndonesia, Poland, and South Africa. At the end of 2023, \nAmazon had invested in 513 global renewable energy \nprojects, including 243 utility-scale wind and solar projects, \nand 270 solar rooftops at our facilities and stores around \nthe world. In 2023 alone, 42 new utility-scale wind and \nsolar projects and 50 new on-site solar energy systems \nbecame operational. Collectively, our portfolio represents \n28 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, an increase \nfrom 20 GW in 2022. This portfolio provides carbon-free \nelectricity to our operations, as well as delivers new carbon-\nfree electricity to the grids in communities where we operate. \nWith this scale, we have been named the world’s largest \ncorporate purchaser of renewable energy for the fourth year \nin a row.5 \nTwo of the most important ways we lower electricity-\nrelated carbon emissions are by improving energy efficiency \nand transitioning to carbon-free energy. To date, we have \nfocused on scaling renewable energy; going forward, the \nnature of our business requires us to leverage additional \ncarbon-free energy options—such as nuclear—to support \nour continued growth and enable us to develop and deploy \nnew technologies such as AI. We are also focused on creating \nnew chips that are increasingly energy-efficient, such as \nAWS Graviton4, the most powerful and energy-efficient \nchip AWS has built. Graviton4 is more energy efficient than \nGraviton3 processors while providing up to 30% better \ncomputing performance, 50% more cores, and 75% more \nmemory bandwidth than Graviton3 processors. By scaling \ncarbon-free energy, we aim to make Amazon a more resilient \nand sustainable business, drive a global transition to cleaner \nenergy, and achieve our commitment to The Climate Pledge \nto reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\nLearn more about our transition to carbon-free energy \n Scope 1\nCarbon intensity (g CO₂e/$GMS‡) \n Scope 2†\n Scope 3†\n* Million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.\n† Scope 2 and 3 carbon emissions are calculated using a market-based method.\n‡ Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of gross merchandise sales.\n§ We updated our Carbon Methodology used for our 2022 and 2023 carbon footprint.\n39.91\n45.75\n55.36\n54.28\n51.76\n5.50\n5.27\n4.07\n3.14\n2.79\n5.76\n9.62\n12.11\n13.32\n14.27\n60.64\n71.54\n70.74\n68.82\n51.17\n2019\n2021\n2020\n2022§\n2023§\n122.8\n102.7\n100.8\n93.0\n80.8\nAmazon’s Carbon Footprint \n(MMT CO2e*)\n12\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWater\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon",

    "text": "Scope 3: Indirect Emissions from Other Sources\nScope 3 emissions include emissions from activities that \ntake place beyond our direct operations, including building \nconstruction, third-party transportation, and the production \nof Amazon-branded products and the materials and \ncomponents used in those products. In 2023, our Scope 3 \nemissions decreased by 5% from 2022 and represented 75% \nof our total carbon footprint. This decrease resulted from \nreductions related to building construction, leased buildings \nand equipment, and third-party transportation, as more \ngoods were shipped by Amazon’s own logistics providers \nversus third-party providers than in 2022.\nBuilding construction is a significant driver of carbon \nemissions in many supply chains due to the associated \nembodied carbon that is emitted. Embodied carbon includes \nany carbon emissions created during the manufacturing \nof building materials, the transport of those materials to \nthe job site, and the construction practices used. Embodied \ncarbon is counted in a company’s carbon footprint the year \nthe building is completed and operational. We aim to reduce \nembodied carbon in building construction by using lower-\nemission concrete, lower-emission steel, and mass timber. In \n2023, 29 Amazon building projects were constructed with \nlower-carbon concrete and steel, and collectively reduced \nembodied carbon by 79,500 metric tons of CO2e, equivalent \nto the emissions generated by 17,200 cars driven for a year.\nBecause Scope 3 emissions are beyond our direct operational \ncontrol, the efforts our suppliers take to reduce their \nemissions help us progress toward our ambition to achieve \nnet-zero carbon emissions by 2040. We will prioritize working \nwith suppliers who are also committed to decarbonization \nand reaching net-zero carbon emissions. We have identified \na list of the highest-emitting suppliers directly supporting \nour operations, and expect those suppliers, who collectively \ncontribute more than 50% of emissions globally to Amazon’s \nScope 3 footprint, to provide a plan for how they will \ndecarbonize their operations and demonstrate real progress \nover time. We will prioritize our business toward those \nwho provide their plans and results on their path to net-\nzero carbon emissions. We are already working with many \nof these suppliers, and will continue our engagement and \nshare learnings. In addition, we also launched our “Amazon \nSustainability Exchange”—a free, publicly available website \nthat democratizes our guidelines, playbooks, science \nmodels, and other resources to help other companies make \nmeaningful progress toward net-zero carbon emissions.\nLearn more about how we’re engaging suppliers to \ndecarbonize our supply chain \nPath to 2040\nWe know the path to net-zero carbon by 2040 will be \nchallenging, but we are making investments, creating new \nways of working, and inventing new solutions to help us \ndecarbonize now and in the future. At Amazon, we think long \nterm, and we’re committed to working collectively with our \nsupply chain and industry partners to create and scale new \ndecarbonization solutions.\nWe’re proud of the work we do, not just within our own \noperations but across the many industries of which we are a \npart. At the end of 2023, The Climate Pledge included 473 \nsignatories focused on achieving net-zero carbon emissions \nby 2040. Signatories are working together more than ever \nbefore, with five new joint action projects launched in \n2023. We are also investing in companies that are building \nbreakthrough technologies and other solutions that could, \nlonger-term, lower the overall cost of decarbonization, even \nin hard-to-abate sectors. One way we do this is through The \nClimate Pledge Fund, Amazon’s $2 billion venture investment \nprogram, which supports the advancement of sustainability-\nfocused technologies and services that will enable us to meet \nour net-zero carbon emissions goal.\nWe will continue to innovate, collaborate, and do the work \nneeded to deliver the best for our customers, progress \ntoward net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and most \nimportantly, contribute to a healthier planet.\nKey Milestones on Our Net-Zero Carbon Journey\n2019\n2020\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2030\n2025\n2040\n100% of the electricity consumed by \nour global operations was matched \nwith renewable energy—seven years \nahead of our original 2030 goal\nAmazon co-founded \nThe Climate Pledge \nwith Global Optimism \nand was the first \ncompany to sign on\nIn 2022, The Climate \nPledge Fund committed at \nleast $50 million to invest \nin female-founded and \nfemale-led climate \ntechnology companies\nAWS committed to being \nwater positive by 2030, \nreturning more water to \nthe communities where \nAWS operates than is \nused in direct operations\n10,000 electric vehicles in our \nIndia delivery fleet by 2025\nInvest in wind and solar farm capacity equal \nto the energy use of all active Echo, Fire TV, \nand Ring devices worldwide by 2025\nThe Climate Pledge Fund\nA $2 billion venture investment \nprogram supporting the \nadvancement of sustainable \ntechnologies and services that \nenable Amazon to meet our \nnet-zero carbon emissions goal\nRight Now Climate Fund\nA $100 million fund for \nnature-based solutions to \nrestore and conserve forests, \nwetlands, and grasslands \naround the world\nAt least 100,000 electric delivery \nvans on the road by 2030, from \nRivian and other manufacturers\nNet-Zero\nCarbon\nEmissions\n500+ signatories of The Climate Pledge\n13\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWater\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon",

First mile includes \nmaritime and airfreight shipping, as well as movement \nby truck and rail. \n•\t Middle mile is the intermediate transportation leg, \nwhere we move shipments between Amazon facilities. It \nis also called long-distance transportation. Middle mile \nincludes commercial trucking, aviation, maritime, and \nintermodal sea and rail. \n•\t Last mile is the final transportation leg that delivers \npackages from Amazon to customers. It includes vans, \ntrucks, and micromobility solutions such as e-cargo bikes \nand on-foot delivery.\nWe have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to transport \nproducts safely, quickly, efficiently, and more sustainably.  \nWe are decarbonizing first, middle, and last mile \ntransportation by: \n•\t Increasing routing and fleet efficiency. In 2023, \nwe restructured our U.S. fulfillment operations by \nreorganizing our national network of fulfillment centers, \nintermediate sort centers, last mile delivery hubs, and \ntransportation fleet into eight regions. This shift ensures \nwe’re producing, packaging, and shipping from facilities \nthat are closer to the communities we serve, which \nreduces the complexity of our shipping network and the \nmiles traveled to get to our customers—helping drive \ndown both carbon emissions and shipping costs. This \nnew model optimizes delivery speed, reduces emissions, \nand provides the breadth of selection that customers \nexpect. In the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, we shipped \nnearly 544 million more items from in-region fulfillment \ncenters than we did during the same period of 2022. \nShipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our \ndelivery stations also reduces the number of stops per \npackage—avoiding nearly 16 million miles driven in \n2023—and decreases our reliance on air transportation.\n•\t Increasing packaging and packing efficiency. We focus \non increasing pack and fill rates—the percentage of \npackage volume that is utilized—and truck fill rates—\nthe percentage of truck volume that is utilized—to fit \nmore products into shipping vehicles. This reduces the \nnumber of trucks we need—and the carbon emissions \nassociated with them—to deliver our products.\n•\t Scaling use of EVs and micromobility \nsolutions. Sending demand signals and scaling \navailability of alternative transportation solutions is \ncritical to accelerating industry progress. This includes \ncharging infrastructure, electric trucks, electric delivery \nvehicles, e-cargo bikes, e-mopeds, and on-foot deliveries \nfrom micromobility hubs.\n•\t Increasing use of alternative-fuel vehicles and low-\ncarbon fuels. The early adoption of lower-carbon fuels \nis another way we are working to minimize the carbon \nfootprint of our transportation and logistics network, \nas well as a critical component to building out the \nalternative fuels market. We are investing in lower-\ncarbon fuels today to encourage industry development \nand demand, with the goal of ultimately making them \nmore accessible and affordable for everyone. \n•\t Partnering on initiatives to decarbonize \ntransportation. We participate in multi-stakeholder \ninitiatives to shift the industry toward lower-carbon \nsolutions at scale, such as EVs, charging infrastructure, \nand lower-carbon fuels.\n•\t Creating lower-carbon shipping options for \ncustomers. We focus on consolidating shipments to \nreduce deliveries, as well as reducing packaging by \nshipping more items in each box and more items in their \noriginal packaging. \nFirst Mile \nFirst mile transportation is the beginning of a product’s \nshipment path from the manufacturer, wholesaler, or \ndistributor to an Amazon facility via ship, airplane, train, or \ntruck. In many cases, first mile shipments cross international \nborders. We are focused on decarbonizing first mile \ntransportation while maintaining efficiency and reliability \nand reducing costs. For instance, we have discovered \ninnovative ways to prioritize ocean and rail transportation to \nreduce our reliance on airfreight.\nOcean transportation has a lower carbon footprint than air \ntransportation does, so we prioritize shipping our products \non ships, whenever feasible. In 2023, we transported 90% of \nour imported transoceanic shipments via ocean freight and \n2% via airfreight. \nOcean Freight\nZero-emission fuel: Along with opting for more efficient \nshipping routes, we also prioritize lower-carbon marine \nbiofuels. In 2021, we were a founding member of the First \nMovers Coalition, a global coalition of companies leveraging \ntheir purchasing power to decarbonize the world’s heavy-\nemitting sectors, such as ocean transportation. Through \nour active participation, we are supporting First Movers \nCoalition’s goal to use maritime ships with zero-emission \nfuels for at least 10% of cargo shipped internationally by \n2030.

Through our \nmembership, we are supporting coZEV’s goal to use maritime \nships with zero-emission fuels for 100% of ocean cargo by \n2040. \nBiofuel: Our investment in maritime biofuel helps to \naccelerate the shipping industry’s transition to zero-emission \nfuels by demonstrating demand for lower-carbon fuel \nalternatives to bunker fuel. In 2023, we transported 10% \nof our ocean cargo via maritime ships powered by lower-\nemission biofuels and finalized a 2023–2024 agreement with \nMaersk through their “ECO Delivery” ocean product offering. \nAs part of this collaboration, Amazon piloted shipping cargo \non the first methanol-powered vessel, from Singapore to \nRotterdam. As availability increases, we will continue to \nincrease the percentage of cargo we transport on these types \nof ships and leverage additional lower-carbon fuels in 2024 \nand beyond.\nLearn more about this landmark zero-emission voyage \nIn early 2023, we co-founded the Zero Emission Maritime \nBuyers Alliance (ZEMBA) with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, \nand Tchibo. ZEMBA seeks to accelerate commercial \ndeployment of zero-emission shipping, enable economies \nof scale, and reduce maritime emissions. Six months after \nits launch, ZEMBA released a request for proposals for zero-\nemission shipping services to be delivered by 2025. This \nwas the first major buyer-led initiative for the transition to \nzero-emission fuels in maritime shipping—one of the most \nchallenging sectors to decarbonize.\nLearn more about how we are improving the shorelines \nand areas surrounding the ocean routes we utilize \nAirfreight\nWhile we prioritize ocean transportation, air transportation \nis an important part of our first mile logistics network, \nthough it represents only 10% of our transoceanic imports. \nAviation is also considered a hard-to-abate sector, which \nis why we are sourcing lower-carbon aviation fuels such \nas sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and using SAF credits to \nreduce our own airfreight emissions as well as working with \npeers on innovative industry-wide solutions. Lower-carbon \naviation fuel, such as SAF, currently represents less than \n0.1% of global aviation fuel and remains cost-prohibitive for \nmost companies. To help address these challenges, Amazon \nis a founding member of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers \nAlliance \n (SABA) and played a critical role in launching the \nSustainable Aviation Fuel certificates (SAFc) Registry   at the \n28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28). \nThe SAFc Registry aims to bring more transparency to \nemissions reduction claims and accelerate SAF deployment.\nMiddle Mile\nMiddle mile transportation starts when packages arrive at an \nAmazon facility and covers the journey between fulfillment \ncenters and sort centers to delivery stations. In addition to \nenhancing routing efficiency through regionalization, we are \ndecarbonizing middle mile transportation by increasing the \nnumber of EVs on the road and at our facilities and adopting \nlower-carbon fuels. We also partner with others to create \nindustry solutions that accelerate decarbonization of this leg \nof the transportation network.\nMiddle Mile Efficiency \nMoving products by rail or sea—instead of on the road, \nby conventional trucks—reduces carbon emissions by an \naverage of nearly 50%. Europe’s geographic landscape and \ninfrastructure in particular often make rail and sea the faster \nand more efficient routing options. In 2023, we increased our \nuse of rail and ocean transportation in Europe by over 50%, \ndistributing products through more than 100 rail lanes and \nmore than 300 sea routes across the continent. This reduced \nour demand for more carbon-intensive transportation \nmethods, such as trucks, in Europe.

We are \ncommitted to having at least 100,000 electric delivery vans—\nfrom Rivian and other manufacturers—­on the road by 2030.\nvehicles for middle mile transportation. In 2024, we aim to \nincrease the number of FCVs deployed in our transportation \nnetwork. \nAmazon began mobile fueling diesel-powered vehicles—\nincluding trucks that operate short, local routes and vehicles \nthat operate within our facilities—with renewable diesel \nat all California and Oregon fulfillment and sort centers in \n2023. Renewable diesel is made from waste fats, greases, \nand other oils. And in India, we are collaborating with \nlocal oil companies to develop renewable diesel and other \nalternative fuels such as compressed biogas. \nTo reduce our logistics-related emissions, Amazon is also \nincreasing the availability of compressed natural gas vehicles \n(CNGs). CNGs are trucks powered by natural gas instead of \ngasoline or diesel fuel. They can reduce carbon emissions \nby at least 75% compared to diesel when refueled with \nRNG. Globally, Amazon had 4,400 CNGs on the road in 2023, \nusing 30 million gallons of RNG. This growth was driven \nby the opening of seven permanent RNG fueling stations \nacross our North American logistics network in partnership \nwith Clean Energy, the largest provider of RNG for the \ntransportation industry in North America.\nPartnerships Accelerating Middle Mile Decarbonization \nTrucking is a challenging area to decarbonize, particularly \nconsidering the long-haul distances driven and the \nrequirements for high-power EV charging infrastructure \nacross transportation routes. Identifying and scaling \nsolutions for this important method of transportation cannot \nbe done by one company alone—it requires the know-how, \nresources, and experience of collaborative partners across \nindustries and sectors.\nIn 2023, Amazon participated in the Smart Freight Centre \n(SFC) Exchange Network, a nonprofit organization whose \nmission is to accelerate the reduction of logistics emissions \nby fostering collaboration. As part of its work, SFC is \nincreasing transparency and accountability around logistics \nemissions. In 2023, SFC and the World Business Council \nfor Sustainable Development (WBCSD) launched guidance \nIn 2023, we increased our total rail load volume by \n45% in Europe and 25% in the U.S. Our sustainable rail \nfreight solutions were recognized by BNSF Railway, which \nselected Amazon as one of the recipients of its 2023 \nSustainability Award.\nMiddle Mile Electric Vehicles \nScaling up middle mile EVs is another way we aim to \ndecarbonize our logistics network, both on the road and \nat our logistics facilities. Amazon and delivery service \nproviders (DSPs) deployed more than 245 electric middle \nmile vehicles in 2023. We also have nearly 18,000 hydrogen-\npowered forklifts operating at more than 81 fulfillment \ncenters, as well as 110 electric yard hostlers—vehicles \nthat move truck trailers around fulfillment centers—in \nNorth America.\nIndian Railways are the backbone of India’s transportation \nsystem thanks to the widespread network of trains that \ntransport millions of people and freight across the country \neach day. In 2019, Amazon became the first e-commerce \ncompany to leverage this vast train network by entering into \nan operational engagement with Indian Railways to meet \nour customer promise of fast and reliable deliveries. We have \ncontinued this collaboration, increasing our use of Indian \nRailways’ electric locomotives to ship packages in 2023. \nWe also partnered with eFast—India’s first national freight \nelectrification platform led by the government policy think \ntank NITI Aayog—to engage policymakers on policies that \ncan help decarbonize rail freight.\nAmazon recognizes that the infrastructure needed to \nsupport the charging of electric heavy goods vehicles \n(eHGVs) at delivery stations and on the road is one barrier \nto scaling their use around the world. That is why we work \nwith eHGV manufacturers and other partners to improve \ncharging infrastructure and electricity grids. For instance, \nwe partner with third-party charge point operators to set \nup charging yards at locations that best serve our Amazon \nsites. In Europe, we published CHALET (Charging Locations \nfor Electric Trucks), a new, open-source tool to help private \nindustry, governments, electricity network operators, and \nlocal authorities determine where to build electric charging \npoints for eHGVs. Transportation and logistics operators \nare encouraged to input data into the tool, which CHALET \nthen uses to generate a ranked list of recommended \ncharger locations.\nMiddle Mile Zero-Emission and Lower-Carbon Fuels \nIn addition to putting EVs on the road, we are exploring ways \nto decarbonize our middle mile transportation operations by \nadopting lower-carbon fuels such as hydrogen, renewable \ndiesel, and renewable natural gas (RNG).6 \nIn 2023, we piloted the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles \n(FCVs) in Europe and Japan. These initiatives will provide us \nwith more information about the right FCV size to maximize \nperformance, determine optimal hydrogen storage and \npower management, and understand the viability of these \nJaya Varma Sinha, CEO of Indian Railways, spoke at the Smbhav Summit \nin 2023.

We also scaled the \nAmazon Hub Delivery program—which partners with small \nand medium-sized businesses to deliver packages in local \nneighborhoods—to over 2,000 partners that delivered nearly \n14 million shipments in 2023, around half of which were \ndelivered on foot or bike.\nCustomer Shipping Options to Avoid Carbon Emissions\nWe offer our customers shipping options that help reduce \nthe carbon emissions associated with the delivery of their \nproducts. We also have programs for sellers to reduce \ndelivery emissions and decrease costs.\nAmazon Day Delivery\nOur Amazon Day shipping option allows Prime members to \nchoose a designated day of the week to receive their orders. \nBy consolidating orders into fewer packages and deliveries, \nwe are avoiding emissions by saving boxes and reducing \ntrips to individual addresses. In 2023, Amazon Day delivery \navoided the use of more than 200 million boxes (up from \nnearly 115 million in 2022) and 226,000 metric tons of CO2e. \nShips in Product Packaging\nOur Ships in Product Packaging program, formerly called \nShips in Own Container, tests and certifies products that can \nship safely in just their original manufacturers’ packaging—\nwithout an additional Amazon box, envelope, or bag. This \nminimizes the packaging materials used for delivery and \nallows packages to take up less space in delivery vehicles, \nincreasing our truck fill rate.\nAmazon recently launched an initiative in the U.S. to \nincrease the number of items tested for qualification in \nthe Ships in Product Packaging program by extending the \nprogram to Fulfillment by Amazon sellers  . The program \nbenefits these sellers by enabling them to provide a better \ncustomer experience while reducing the costs associated with \nfulfillment.\nLearn more about how we are reducing our packaging \nfootprint \nBuilding Construction and \nOperations \nOur building portfolio comprises thousands of owned \nand leased facilities in more than 60 countries, including \noperations buildings, grocery stores, corporate offices, \nand data centers \n . The construction, operation, and \ndecommissioning of these buildings accounted for one \nfifth of Amazon’s total carbon emissions in 2023, which \nis why we’re committed to implementing and scaling \ndecarbonization solutions and processes to reduce the \nfootprint of this sector of our business.\nCarbon emissions connected to our buildings fall into two \ncategories: embodied emissions and operational emissions. \nEmbodied emissions in the buildings sector are generated \nfrom the manufacture, transportation, installation, \nmaintenance, and disposal of building materials. Operational \nemissions refer to resources consumed by day-to-day \nprocesses needed to run our business, including computing, \nlighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, refrigeration systems, \nand operating other equipment. \nIn 2023, we delivered more than 680 million packages \nglobally using more than 24,000 electric delivery vehicles, \nincluding 19,000 electric delivery vans, around the world. \nUnited States \n•\t Our U.S. fleet included 11,800 electric delivery vans \nfrom Rivian, up from more than 2,600 in 2022. \n•\t We delivered 431 million packages via EVs.\nEurope\n•\t We deployed more than 300 electric delivery vans from \nRivian on the road in Europe as part of our broader fleet \nof more than 3,000 electric delivery vehicles.\n•\t We delivered 150 million packages via EVs.\nIndia\n•\t We nearly doubled the number of EVs in our Indian \ndelivery fleet to more than 7,200, including 3,600 \nelectric delivery vans, and more than 3,600 two-, \nthree-, and four-wheel vehicles.\n•\t We delivered 81 million packages via EVs. \n•\t We installed charging infrastructure near more than \n100 Amazon locations.\nIn India, 81% of last mile deliveries are made by delivery \nIn August 2023, we began transporting \npackages in London using both zero-emission \nmiddle mile vehicles (electric heavy-duty \ntrucks) and last mile vehicles (electric vans). \nWhile our current volumes of these vehicles are \nsmall, this pilot provides important learnings \nas we continue our work to decarbonize our \ntransportation network.\nLast Mile Electric Delivery Vehicles  \nby Region 7\nRegion\n2022\n2023\nU.S.\n2,600\n11,800\nEurope\n1,220\n3,000+\nIndia\n3,800\n7,200+\nReducing Emissions with Micromobility Delivery Solutions\nMicromobility hubs are smaller, centrally located delivery \nstations.

    "text": "Globally, our work to reduce carbon emissions related to our \nbuildings focuses on: \n•\t Implementing foundational efficiency initiatives: We \nare instituting and improving data collection practices \nto better track our performance and inform our efforts \nto improve efficiency and reduce energy use and carbon \nemissions across our buildings portfolio. \n•\t Scaling renewable energy and lower-carbon \napproaches to heating and cooling: We use on-site \nrenewables, such as rooftop solar installations on \nbuildings we operate, as well as renewable energy from \nthe grid to power our buildings. We’re also scaling \nup our use of refrigerants with low global warming \npotential (GWP) and utilizing alternative fuels as backup \npower sources and to cool data centers.\n•\t Creating industry solutions to reduce embodied \ncarbon: We collaborate with suppliers, industry partners, \nsignatories of The Climate Pledge, and governing \nbodies to develop and implement standards, alternative \nmaterials, and solutions that address environmental \nchallenges specific to the buildings sector.\nImplementing Foundational Efficiency Initiatives\nWe are working to make our buildings more energy-efficient \nand reduce their carbon emissions. This work starts with \ncollecting robust, accurate, timely, and meaningful data to \nidentify opportunities for improvement.\nOur Enterprise Building Management System (EBMS) is one \nof the tools we use to measure and track energy efficiency \nat our existing sites. This standardized platform manages \nfacility energy use and controls various building systems to \nminimize associated carbon emissions. Many of our buildings \nhave thousands of sensors to monitor water use, air flow, \ntemperature, and other environmental variables, which help \nus further improve and optimize our designs. By the end \nof 2023, our EBMS was active in more than 1,200 facilities \nglobally, a 14% increase from 2022. \nWe increase energy efficiency across our building operations \nthrough lighting and EBMS retrofits as well as rooftop \nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning unit replacements. \nLighting retrofits alone have saved 1.23 billion megawatt-\nhours (MWh) of energy and avoided more than 873,000 \nmetric tons of CO2e from 2017 to 2023. These upgrades have \nincluded converting all non-LED lamps to high-efficiency LED \nfixtures with dimming controls.\nValidating Our Progress\nAs teams across Amazon progress toward the \ndecarbonization of our buildings, we’ve begun to \nvalidate our efforts using the International Living Future \nInstitute’s Zero Carbon Certification (ZCC). This third-party \ncertification program validates improvements to our building \ndecarbonization efforts and provides clear accountability \nfor our internal teams and external building partners. This \nrigorous, carbon-centric program requires us to provide \nactual measured—not predicted—performance over one \nyear of building occupancy to assess credible carbon emission \nreductions. This means that we are just now receiving \ncertifications for the first pilot projects we submitted for \nevaluation.\nAmazon achieved two full certifications for building projects \nin 2023: an Amazon Fresh store in Seattle, Washington—\nwhich was the world’s first building of its type to achieve \nthe certification—and a Same Day delivery station in \nSacramento, California—the first-ever North American \nlogistics building to be certified. We are working to scale \nalignment with this certification program throughout our \ncompany, with dozens of projects across our global buildings \nportfolio currently using ZCC standards to measure and \nvalidate our decarbonization efforts.\nWe want our corporate offices to be both inspiring \nplaces to work and models of what is possible when it \ncomes to sustainable design and construction.\nWe built our second headquarters (HQ2) in Arlington, \nVirginia, with sustainability in mind. Opened in May \n2023, HQ2 runs on 100% renewable electricity \nand achieves energy savings of 24% relative to a \ncomparable Leadership in Energy and Environmental \nDesign (LEED) baseline. In March 2024, it became the \nlargest project (by building square footage) in the U.S. \nto receive LEED v4 Platinum certification.\nUsing an advanced lower-carbon concrete mix design \nthat included CarbonCure, which we invested in through \nThe Climate Pledge Fund \n , we achieved a 20% \nreduction in HQ2’s concrete structure carbon footprint \ncompared to the industry baseline.8 This avoided \n14,700 metric tons of CO2e, which is the equivalent of \ntaking 3,500 cars off the road in the U.S. for an entire \nyear. More than 40 Amazon sites globally now use this \nsame CarbonCure technology.\nSustainability at Our Second Headquarters \nDesign elements at HQ2 incorporate native flora and fauna \nand use earth tones and natural materials, such as wood and \nstone, to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n18\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWater\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon",

    "text": "Scaling Renewable Energy and Lower-Carbon \nApproaches to Heating and Cooling\nWe are working to reduce the emissions associated with \noperating our buildings by using renewable energy and other \nlower-carbon alternatives. \nScaling Renewable Energy\nAt the end of 2023, Amazon had 270 rooftop solar projects \nat our facilities around the globe. We brought 50 new on-site \nsolar energy systems online in 2023, for a total capacity of \n58 MW. These on-site solar energy systems are estimated to \ngenerate 123,000 MWh annually—enough energy to power \nover 33,600 European homes—and avoid the equivalent of \nroughly 47,400 metric tons of CO2e each year compared to \nnonrenewable electricity sources.\nLearn more about how we are scaling carbon-free energy \nLower-Emission Refrigerants \nRefrigerants are cooling agents used in air conditioners, heat \npumps, refrigerators, and freezers. Refrigerants with high \nGWP—such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—contribute to \nclimate change by trapping more heat in the atmosphere \nthan CO2. That’s why Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market \nuse low-GWP refrigerants, such as CO2 refrigerants, to help \ngrocery stores reduce emissions.\nBy the end of 2023, 46 Whole Foods Market stores were \nusing low-GWP refrigeration systems. Whole Foods Market \nhas also committed to using only low-GWP refrigeration \nsystems in new stores in North America starting in 2025. \nTogether, Amazon and Whole Foods Market donated to the \nNorth American Sustainable Refrigeration Council in 2023 to \naccelerate the council’s efforts to train the next generation of \nskilled technicians needed to install and maintain sustainable \nrefrigeration systems.\nEnergy Efficiency and Alternative Fuels in AWS \nData Centers\nAWS takes a holistic approach to minimizing energy and \nwater consumption in its operations, including in data \ncenters. For example, AWS is increasing the use of free-\nair cooling systems that cool servers with outside air. This \navoids the need for energy-intensive compressor-based \ncooling systems throughout much of the year. Even during \npeak summer temperatures, data centers can utilize direct \nevaporative cooling, a process that uses water to cool the air \nand remove heat from servers. \nIn 2023, AWS started transitioning to hydrotreated vegetable \noil (HVO) to power backup generators at its data centers \nin the U.S. and Europe. HVO is a type of renewable diesel \nmade from waste cooking oil or vegetable, plant, and residue \noils. AWS sites in Ireland, Sweden, and Oregon were among \nthe first to make the switch to HVO. Renewable diesel is \nreadily available in regions such as the U.S. West and parts \nof Europe, but sourcing in areas such as the U.S. East and \nMidwest remains a challenge due to the lack of distribution \nterminals and established supply chains for this type of \nfuel. In response, fuel distributors are beginning to invest in \nrenewable diesel terminals along the U.S. East Coast, and \nAWS plans to explore these sourcing opportunities once they \nare available.\nCreating Industry Solutions to Reduce \nEmbodied Carbon\nDecarbonizing the buildings sector is a challenge no one \ncompany or organization can solve alone. We can, however, \naccelerate progress by engaging with industry partners \nto develop and scale innovations that reduce carbon \nemissions associated with the construction, operation, and \ndecommissioning of buildings across sectors and markets.\nUsing Lower-Carbon Materials\nWe are working to reduce embodied carbon in our \ninfrastructure by increasing the use of lower-carbon \nmaterials in Amazon buildings, such as lower-carbon steel, \nlower-carbon concrete, and mass timber, a lower-carbon \nstructural wood product that can replace concrete and steel \nin building construction.\nIn 2023, 29 Amazon building projects were constructed \nwith lower-carbon concrete and steel, collectively reducing \nembodied carbon by over 79,000 metric tons of CO2e. \nAmazon used mass timber when building HQ2 and, in 2023, \nprogressed in the design and construction of three new \nbuildings that will use mass timber structural elements.\nIn 2023, AWS built 36 data centers with lower-carbon \nconcrete, up from 16 in 2022. AWS also tested a low-carbon, \nperformance-based ASTM C1157 Hydraulic Cement by \nOzinga, a concrete, bulk materials, and logistics solutions \nsupplier, which achieved a 64% reduction in embodied \ncarbon compared to the industry average. In January 2024, \nAWS updated its design standards to require the use of \nconcrete with 35% less embodied carbon than the industry \naverage in new data centers around the world.\nWe can also mitigate a building’s carbon footprint by using \nhigher-strength structural steel, which is made by cooling \nthe metal quickly during manufacturing. The manufacturing \nprocess of lower-carbon steel gives it a higher strength-\nto-weight ratio, which means that less material—and as a \nresult, less embodied carbon—is used to perform the same \nfunction. By incorporating higher-strength steel into its data \ncenter structural designs, AWS has reduced steel content by \n70 tons for each two-story data center and 137 tons for each \nthree-story data center, decreasing emissions by 63 and 124 \nmetric tons of CO2e, respectively. In 2023, AWS built 31 data \ncenters with lower-carbon steel, up from 10 in 2022.  \nUsing lower-carbon steel and concrete enabled AWS to avoid \nover 46,700 metric tons of CO2e in 2023—equivalent to the \ncarbon emissions generated from driving over 11,100 cars in \nthe U.S. for one year. We will continue working with suppliers \nto achieve even greater carbon savings in future Amazon \nbuildings by increasing the use of lower-carbon materials in \ntheir construction.\nPartnering to Develop Industry Standards for Measuring \nEmbodied Carbon\nEmbodied carbon is our largest source of building-related \ncarbon emissions and something we address in our  \nbuilding design and construction strategies. Since 2022, we \nhave been using the Embodied Carbon in Construction  \nCalculator   to track and report the embodied carbon of our \nbuilding construction materials. This open-access industry \ntool allows us to benchmark, assess, and reduce embodied \ncarbon. It focuses on emissions from the construction \nmaterials supply chain, using a database of digital, third-\nparty-verified Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). \nEPDs are a way for manufacturers to take comprehensive, \nthird-party-verified life cycle assessments (LCAs) and turn \nthem into standardized labels for their products. We use this \ndata to select lower-carbon construction materials.\nAmazon asks our building contractors, including \narchitectural, design, and construction companies, to \nuse this tool as part of our building delivery process. \nIn 2023, this requirement increased the use of the tool \nby 231 building contractors across 47 companies and 26 \ncountries. This uptake has helped scale and deploy expertise \nin how to reduce embodied carbon across the broader \nbuilding industry.\nIn 2023, we worked with the UK Chartered Institution of \nBuilding Services Engineers (CIBSE) and our supply chain \npartners to create public-facing embodied carbon baselining \nguidance for the logistics sector. This guidance, called \nTechnical Memorandum 65.3   , seeks to help professionals \nacross Europe assess and understand the embodied \ncarbon of material handling and mechanical, electrical, \nand plumbing equipment. Using data that is new to the \nindustry, Technical Memorandum 65.3 will enable Amazon, \nour supply chain partners, and our peers to establish a \nbaseline understanding of carbon emissions from industrial \nequipment, paving the way to ultimately identifying \nadditional carbon reduction opportunities.\nServers and Hardware\nAs the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted \ncloud provider, AWS is committed to building a lower-carbon \nbusiness for its customers and the planet. AWS designs \nits data centers—including servers and hardware—for \nefficiency, resiliency, and a lower carbon footprint. \n19\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWater\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon",

Inferentia2 is up \nto 50% more energy-efficient and can reduce costs by up \nto 40% against comparable Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \n(EC2) instances.\nMeanwhile, AWS Graviton4 is the latest generation of chips \ndesigned by AWS and the most powerful and energy-\nefficient chip AWS has built as of 2023. Graviton4 provides \nup to 30% better computing performance, 50% more \ncores, and 75% more memory bandwidth than Graviton3 \nprocessors while being more energy efficient.\nPartnering to Reduce Carbon Emissions in the \nSemiconductor Industry\nAWS knows that by collaborating across the entire \nsemiconductor industry, it can drive carbon emission \nreductions at a scale greater than what is possible on its own. \nTo that end, AWS is partnering with its suppliers to decrease \ntheir operational emissions and engage their own upstream \nsupply chains to do the same. In 2023, AWS joined the \nSemiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC), an organization \nfocused on reducing carbon emissions across the global \nsemiconductor supply chain. The SCC collaboration \naccelerates decarbonization for member company operations \nand enables new solutions and approaches for adoption.\nProducts and Devices \nAmazon Private Brands\nTwo of our private brands, Amazon Essentials and \nAmazon Basics, make products across many categories, \nincluding clothing, bedroom furniture and mattresses, \nkitchen appliances and cookware, toys, pet essentials, and \nworkout gear. Amazon works with suppliers around the \nworld to manufacture these products at a high quality and \ngreat value. \nAWS is reducing emissions from transporting \nhardware, including racks and their related \ncomponents, by using more sustainable fuels \nand less carbon-intensive modes of shipping \nwhere possible.\n•\t Increasing ocean freight: In 2023, AWS \ntransported approximately 6,600 metric tons \nof hardware components on cargo ships, \navoiding approximately 65,000 metric tons of \nCO2e by reducing airfreight in favor of ocean \nfreight where possible. \n•\t Investing in lower-carbon fuels: AWS is \nencouraging its suppliers to decarbonize \nlong-haul transportation, including through \nthe use of SAF. In 2023, AWS purchased \nover 6 million liters of SAF, which avoided \napproximately 15,600 metric tons of CO2e \ncompared to conventional aviation fuel. \n•\t Making ground deliveries using EVs: AWS \nis increasing the use of EVs for equipment-\nrelated ground deliveries. In Dublin and \nSingapore, for example, AWS worked with \ntransportation providers to transport racks, \nloose gear, and other components to data \ncenter locations using electric trucks.\nReducing Emissions from the \nTransportation of Data Center Hardware\nAWS’s scale allows for higher resource utilization and energy \nefficiency than the typical on-premises data center. From the \ninfrastructure that powers its servers to the techniques that \nkeep them cool, efficiency is a primary goal for every part of \nthe AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure. \nThe AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure is built on AWS’s own \ncustom hardware and optimized for workloads run by AWS \ncustomers. Research shows that in North America, AWS can \nlower its customers’ workload carbon footprints by up to \n96% compared to on-premises computing workloads when \nthe electricity AWS uses is matched with 100% renewable \nenergy—a goal that Amazon, including AWS, achieved in 2023.\nAWS is reducing emissions related to server use and \nnetworking equipment by increasing server lifespan. This \nincludes refining software to run more efficiently, which \nlowers stress on hardware and extends the amount of time \nit can be used. In February 2024, AWS announced that the \naverage expected life of its servers had improved from five \nto six years. To support these efforts, AWS has a robust \nmaintenance and repair program in place that is designed \nto increase component reuse and further reduce carbon \nemissions and waste across its supply chain.\nLearn more about how AWS is advancing circular \neconomy principles \nEnhancing Chip Efficiency\nOne of the most visible ways AWS is innovating for power \nefficiency is through its investment in purpose-built chips. \nA chip is a tiny wafer of semiconducting material with \nan embedded electronic circuit. It contains millions of \nmicroscopic electronic components called transistors that \ntransmit data signals. Chips today are high-performance \nprocessors that power all types of advanced analytics, \ngraphics, and machine learning applications. \nIn 2023, AWS launched Inferentia2, the second generation \nof its Inferentia chip, developed to deliver the highest \nCarbon emissions from the materials and manufacturing \nof these products are part of our Scope 3 carbon footprint. \nWe know that supporting our suppliers’ understanding of \nthe factors that influence a product’s carbon footprint can \nenable future innovation and avoid carbon emissions across \nour supply chain.\nIn 2023, we worked with our top suppliers to develop carbon \nfootprints for the products responsible for over half the \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our private brands. These \ninsights informed the creation of joint abatement plans, which \nhelp avoid future product emissions through actions including \nmoving to recycled materials, using renewable energy to \npower manufacturing facilities, and reducing packaging. \nFor example, we began using recycled polyester certified \nby Textile Exchange’s Global Recycled Standard, which now \nrepresents 16% of the polyester we use for Amazon Essentials \napparel products. We also worked with Amazon Private \nBrands battery suppliers to reduce product packaging weight \nby 13%. In 2024, we aim to expand our product carbon \nmeasurement activities to a larger group of suppliers.\nLearn more about how we focus on sustainability \nthroughout the lifecycle of our products \nAmazon Grocery and Whole Foods Market\nAmazon Grocery and Whole Foods Market teams are working \nwith HowGood—an independent research company and data \nplatform with the world’s largest database on food product \nsustainability—to measure and improve the impact of our \nfood products across multiple categories, including carbon \nemissions, soil health, and water usage. HowGood measures \nthe carbon footprint of our products based on each product’s \ningredient breakdown, sourcing locations, and certifications, \ninstead of using industry averages.

These projects include manure management \nwith dairy farmers, planting native grasses on farms in \ncollaboration with grain and legume suppliers, and process \nelectrification and feed efficiency with seafood suppliers.\nDevices\nAmazon’s sustainability strategy considers the entire \nlifecycle of our devices—from how we build them to how \nour customers use and retire them. We strive to make \neach generation of new Amazon devices more carbon- and \nenergy-efficient and less resource-intensive than the last. \nIn 2023, we published the carbon footprint of newly \nlaunched Echo, eero, Ring, Fire TV, and Fire tablet devices \non the product detail pages of our U.S. Amazon.com site, \nalong with product sustainability fact sheets for each device. \nFact sheets provide customers with a detailed breakdown of \nemissions throughout the device’s lifecycle, including those \nresulting from the extraction, production, and transportation \nof raw materials and device parts; the energy associated with \ndevice use; and end-of-life processing. We also published the \nAmazon Devices Product Carbon Footprint Methodology   \nto give customers insight into how we calculate the carbon \nfootprint of our devices.\nMany of our devices offer a Low Power Mode feature, which \nreduces energy consumption when the device is idle. Our \nlatest Echo and Fire TV devices, for example, feature Low \nPower Mode, and we are delivering updates to introduce this \nfeature in older devices already in use. By the end of 2023, \nover 67% of Echo devices and Fire TVs had Low Power Mode, \nup from over 60% in 2022.\nAmazon supports the development of new renewable energy \ncapacity to match the electricity used by our customers’ \ndevices. This renewable energy comes from investments \nin off-site wind and solar farms. Amazon may choose to \npurchase additional environmental attributes, such as \nrenewable energy certificates in the U.S. and Guarantees of \nOrigin in the EU, to signal our support for renewable energy \nin the grids where we operate, in line with the expected \nenergy generation of the projects we’ve contracted. By the \nend of 2022, we had contracted enough renewable energy \ncapacity through new wind and solar farms to equal the \nexpected electricity used by all active Echo, Fire TV, and \nRing devices globally by 2025. Some of these wind and solar \nprojects are operational today; others are currently under \nconstruction and expected to begin operating in 2024.\nLearn more about how we calculate the percentage of \nrenewable energy matched to the electricity used by \nAmazon devices \nIn 2022, we announced a collaboration with the Carbon \nTrust, which partners with businesses, governments, and \norganizations around the world to accelerate the transition \nto net-zero carbon emissions. We work with the Carbon \nTrust on technical specifications for decarbonizing the use \nphase of internet-connected devices. As part of this work, \nthroughout 2023, we partnered with Samsung, Meta, \nMicrosoft, and Comcast to develop standards that provide \npractical, meaningful steps for mitigating emissions at the \ncustomer use stage of the device lifecycle.\nReducing embodied carbon in our hardware requires us \nto decarbonize all parts of the device lifecycle, including \nmanufacturing. We encourage Amazon device suppliers to \nreduce their manufacturing emissions, including by using \nrenewable energy. As of the end of 2023, we’ve received \ncommitments from 49 device suppliers to work with us \non decarbonization, up from 28 suppliers in 2022. We \nalso helped 21 suppliers develop renewable energy plans, \nincluding final assembly suppliers that make up over 70% of \nour direct manufacturing spend for Echo, Kindle, Fire tablet, \nFire TV, Ring, Blink, and eero devices and accessories. \nLearn more about how we make our products with \nsustainability in mind \nCarbon Neutralization\nAmazon’s first priority under The Climate Pledge is to \neliminate emissions within the value chain of our businesses, \nkeeping pace with science-aligned pathways to the \ntemperature targets established by the Paris Agreement. \nIn parallel, we are investing in climate mitigation outside \nof our value chain (“carbon neutralization”), and we plan to \nneutralize any emissions that cannot be eliminated by 2040. \nWe’re making targeted investments and developing science-\nled partnerships that are making an impact today, while \nalso aiming to inspire global climate action and build the \nfoundation for credible neutralization initiatives at scale.\nEngaging Suppliers \nAs we progress on our net-zero carbon emissions journey, \nAmazon is continuing to engage suppliers in the critical work \nof reducing their operational emissions and working with \ntheir own upstream supply chains to do the same. We have \nidentified a list of the highest-emitting suppliers directly \nsupporting our operations, and expect those suppliers, who \ncollectively contribute more than 50% of emissions globally \nto Amazon’s Scope 3 footprint, to provide a plan for how \nthey will decarbonize their operations and demonstrate real \nprogress over time. We will prioritize our business toward \nthose who provide their plans and results on their path to \nnet-zero carbon emissions. In addition, we also launched our \n“Amazon Sustainability Exchange”—a free, publicly available \nwebsite that democratizes our guidelines, playbooks, science \nmodels, and other resources to help other companies make \nmeaningful progress toward net-zero carbon emissions.\nLearn more about how our new Amazon Sustainability \nExchange is helping our selling partners reach their \nsustainability goals \nOur carbon neutralization approach focuses on three \nactions outside of our value chain. Based on climate science, \nwe know that these areas have a significant unmet need for \ninvestment and can deliver critical mitigation benefits: \n1.\tReducing deforestation\n2.\tAdvancing the removal of carbon from the atmosphere \nwith nature-based solutions\n3.\tScaling up carbon removal technologies\nToday’s carbon credit market is fragmented, complex, and \nopaque. At Amazon, we use the best available science to \ndesign and evaluate projects and measure, verify, and \nmonitor carbon credits.9 We also use robust methodologies \nto verify that the projects we support do, in fact, neutralize \ncarbon. In doing so, we are paving the way for a future \nwhere carbon credits are a quantifiable, real, permanent, and \nsocially beneficial method by which to reduce and remove \ncarbon from the atmosphere.\nIn recent years, we’ve focused on developing and improving \nnew methods to better evaluate the effectiveness of forest \nrestoration projects. As part of an independent working \ngroup made up of leading carbon market experts, scientists, \nand conservation professionals, we helped develop ABACUS, \na rigorous set of principles and requirements for quantifying \nthe climate benefits of restoration projects.\nABACUS aims to quantify the complete set of climate impacts \nassociated with restoration projects. One example of this is \n“leakage:” when a project designed to restore forests displaces \nproduction and leads to deforestation somewhere else. \nABACUS requires projects to maintain or enhance agricultural \nproduction to avoid leakage. ABACUS also requires a data-\ndriven dynamic baseline that compares carbon removal \nprogress over time to control areas that are not restored.\nReducing Deforestation\nWe have made an ambitious pledge to protect nature and \nmitigate climate change through the Lowering Emissions by \n21\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWater\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon",

AWS is supporting the government of the State of \nPará in designing and deploying SeloVerde (Green Seal), a \ncutting-edge AI tool to address climate change challenges \nand traceability in supply chains with a high risk of \ndeforestation. SeloVerde combines government databases, \ninnovative map services, and land-use data from high spatial \nresolution satellite imagery. This allows industry stakeholders \naccess to information that helps them make environmentally \nresponsive, data-based purchasing decisions for commodities \nsuch as cattle and soy.\nAdvancing the Removal of Carbon from the \nAtmosphere with Nature-Based Solutions\nNature-based carbon removal, when done well, harnesses \nthe power of photosynthesis to enhance the carbon stored \nin natural and managed ecosystems, like forests and \ngrasslands. These projects have the additional benefit of \nhelping preserve the natural world by creating wildlife \nhabitat, promoting biodiversity, improving water quality, and \nreducing flood risk.\nIn 2023, we expanded our investments in nature-based \ncarbon removal with two new agroforestry projects in the \nAmazon rainforest. Located in Peru and Brazil, these projects \naim to integrate trees into farming systems while improving \nthe livelihoods of surrounding farming communities. \nAdditionally, they demonstrate an innovative new quality \nstandard for measuring and verifying carbon removal in \nagroforestry and restoration projects.\nWe also created the Agroforestry and Restoration \nAccelerator, which aims to restore degraded lands in ways \nthat both remove carbon from the atmosphere and improve \nthe livelihoods of local communities. The Accelerator \nexperiments with scalable business models, landholder \nengagement strategies, and measurement techniques to \nsupport agroforestry and native restoration on small-scale \nfamily farms in Brazil.\nLearn more about how we are advancing nature-based \nsolutions \nScaling Up Carbon Removal Technologies\nIn 2023, we signed an agreement to support what is \nexpected to be the world’s largest deployment of direct air \ncapture (DAC). DAC is an emerging set of technologies that \nchemically scrub CO2 from the air. The captured CO2 is then \nstored deep underground or used in applications such as \nbuilding materials (including concrete, brick, and cement) \nand low-carbon fuels. We committed to purchasing carbon \ndioxide removal credits equaling 250,000 metric tons of CO2 \nfrom 1PointFive, which is currently constructing its first DAC \nplant in Texas. When fully operational, the plant is expected \nto be the largest in the world, with capacity to capture up to \n500,000 metric tons of CO2 annually.\nAmazon also supports CarbonCapture Inc., a climate \ntechnology startup recognized for its pioneering modular \nDAC systems. The company’s patented modular open \nsystems architecture allows the swapping of new sorbents—\nmaterials used to absorb CO2—as they become available. \nMaximizing sorbent performance is one way to drive down \nthe cost of DAC over time to unlock scale. CarbonCapture Inc. \nwill make up to 100,000 carbon removal credits available \nto Amazon. The Climate Pledge Fund also made an equity \ninvestment in CarbonCapture Inc. to help accelerate its \ngrowth and scale its operations.\nLearn more about Amazon’s Right Now Climate Fund \nThe Climate Pledge\nThe Climate Pledge is a commitment to reach net-zero carbon \nemissions by 2040. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge \nwith Global Optimism in 2019 and was the first company to \nsign on. The Climate Pledge brings the world’s top companies \ntogether to drive joint action, cross-sector collaboration, and \nresponsible change. Companies signing up to The Climate \nPledge agree to the following three areas of action:\n•\t Regular reporting: Measure and report GHG emissions \non a regular basis.\n•\t Carbon elimination: Implement decarbonization \nstrategies in line with the Paris Agreement through \nbusiness change and innovations, including efficiency \nimprovements, renewable energy, materials reductions, \nand other carbon emissions elimination strategies.\n•\t Credible offsets: Neutralize any remaining emissions \nwith additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and \nsocially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual \ncarbon emissions by 2040.\nThe Climate Pledge celebrates its fifth anniversary in \nSeptember 2024. While companies will chart their own paths \nto net-zero carbon emissions, signing The Climate Pledge \nreinforces their commitment to sustainability, holds them \naccountable to their goals, and provides new opportunities \nfor collaboration and a collective knowledge base to \naccelerate their progress. At the end of 2023, The Climate \nPledge represented 473 signatories in 42 countries and \n59 industries.\nIn 2023, 77 additional companies signed The Climate \nPledge, including Mastercard, Sony, and T-Mobile. Amazon \nencourages our suppliers to sign The Climate Pledge, and \nin 2023, nine Amazon transportation and logistics suppliers \nbecame signatories, including CTT Portugal Post, Global Feed \nEcotrans, Poste Italiane, and Emirates Post.\nLearn more about how global companies are working \ntogether to address the climate crisis through  \nThe Climate Pledge \nPartnering with Others to Scale Progress\nWith 473 signatories, The Climate Pledge focused more on \ncross-industry collaboration in 2023 than ever before. In \n2023, The Climate Pledge launched five joint action projects \ninvolving its signatories to accelerate progress to net-zero \ncarbon emissions by 2040. Working together, signatories \naddressed tough problems in hard-to-abate sectors to \npromote technological innovation, send demand signals, \naddress supply chain conundrums, and encourage the \nintegration of climate justice business practices. So far, 24 \nsignatories have joined The Climate Pledge projects related \nto lower-emission supply chain transportation solutions, \ncircularity, increasing urban charging infrastructure, \nelectrifying middle mile freight, and data transparency.\nLaneshift is one example of The Climate Pledge’s joint action \nprojects. In 2023, The Climate Pledge and C40, a global \nnetwork of nearly 100 mayors of the world’s leading cities, \ndeveloped Laneshift to accelerate the transition to zero-\nemission electric trucks and charging infrastructure across \nmajor cities in India and Latin America.

In 2023, Laneshift set up operations and \ninitiated groundwork, including hiring staff and establishing \nglobal key performance indicators. \nThe Climate Pledge also launched Passport, an online \ncommunity for its signatories that provides practical tools \nand industry expert connections to help them meet their \nemission reduction goals. As part of this, The Climate Pledge \nreleased its first training course on Passport Academy, a \nprofessional development online learning tool. Leaders from \nAmazon, Brooks Running, CDP, and more teach the course, \nYour Practical Guide to Measurement and Reporting, which \ninforms participants about best practices in measurement \nand reporting.\nThe Climate Pledge signatories also use Passport to stay \nconnected throughout the year and during events such as \nCOP and Climate Week. \nThe Climate Pledge Fund\nThe Climate Pledge Fund is a $2 billion venture investment \nprogram supporting the advancement of sustainable \ntechnologies and services that enable Amazon to meet our \nnet-zero carbon emissions goal. It specifically targets hard-\nto-abate sectors for investment, with the goal of supporting \ncompanies building breakthrough solutions that could \neventually lower the overall cost to decarbonize Amazon and \nthe broader industry. \nIn 2023, The Climate Pledge Fund made nine investments—\nincluding both new and follow-on investments for existing \nportfolio companies—bringing its total investment \nportfolio to 24 companies. The Climate Pledge Fund’s new \ninvestments covered a broad set of categories including \npackaging (Genecis Bioindustries), grocery and agriculture \n(Windfall Bio), and transportation (Forum Mobility). The \nClimate Pledge Fund also invested in a new category—\ncarbon removal—through its support of CarbonCapture Inc.\nLearn more about how we are using new technologies to \nremove carbon from the atmosphere \nAccelerating Climate Solutions from \nFemale Founders\nAs part of The Climate Pledge Fund’s broader dedication \nto accelerate female-led climate solutions, in 2022, \nit committed at least $50 million to invest in female-\nfounded and female-led climate technology companies. \nThis investment includes the support of incubators and \naccelerators focused on women entrepreneurs and is \ndesigned to help address the gender equity funding gap that \ncurrently exists for women in climate technology.\nIn 2023, The Climate Pledge Fund invested in Genecis \nBioindustries, a women-led climate tech company in the \nU.S. founded by scientist Luna Yu. Yu and her team are \nusing specialized bacteria to turn organic waste—such \nas bread crusts and other food scraps—into bioplastic, a \nbiodegradable and easily recyclable alternative to plastic \npackaging.

Our public policy team works with policymakers, \nmultilateral organizations, industry associations, coalitions, \nand other partners on numerous regulatory and policy \nissues. Specifically, we seek to advance and incentivize \ndecarbonization, supporting policies that scale zero-emission \nfuels, advance zero-emission vehicle deployment and \nassociated infrastructure, drive the deployment of carbon-\nfree energy, modernize the grid, and accelerate investments \nin clean technologies.\nLearn more about how we advocate for strong climate \naction   and global renewable energy policies \nLooking Forward\nReaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 will be \nchallenging. Achieving this ambitious goal will require a \nmultifaceted approach that spans Amazon’s delivery and \nlogistics networks; building construction and operations; \nservers and hardware; grocery, products, and devices; and \npackaging operations. We will continue working to reduce \ncarbon emissions, including by expanding our use of carbon-\nfree energy and switching to lower-carbon materials and \nfuels where possible. We know that we can make even \ngreater progress when we collaborate with others, and we \nwill continue to engage external partners—from expert \ncoalitions to our diverse network of suppliers—to scale our \nefforts to decarbonize worldwide in the service of building a \nbetter future for all.\nto accelerate climate change innovations. We pledged $3 \nmillion to the USAID-led Climate Gender Equity Fund (CGEF), \na public-private partnership that leverages funding to scale \nclimate finance that advances gender-equitable climate \naction. Since its launch in November 2022, CGEF’s founding \nmembers have committed a combined $20 million to the \nfund. USAID announced an additional $5 million investment \nduring COP28 in November 2023. The funding will be used \nover the next several years to make grants to businesses, \ninvestment vehicles, accelerators, incubators, and grassroots \norganizations supporting climate solutions that are led by \nand benefit women.\nIn 2023, CGEF selected the first cohort of women-led \norganizations to receive grants, each of which is focused on \nadvancing gender-equitable climate action in Africa.

We are proud to have achieved this \ngoal in 2023, seven years early, with 100% of the electricity \nconsumed by Amazon matched with renewable energy \nsources, up from 90% in 2022. This achievement is an \nimportant step on our journey to achieve net-zero carbon \nemissions by 2040, and we will continue to focus on reducing \nemissions through carbon-free energy as part of our \ncommitment to The Climate Pledge. \nOur journey has included enabling major solar, wind, and \nbattery storage projects around the world, including the first \nwind farm in Mississippi, and becoming the first corporate \nAs of January 2024, Amazon had announced:\n513\t Global renewable energy projects\n243\tUtility-scale wind and solar projects\n270\tSolar rooftops at our facilities and stores\nWind and solar will continue to be a critical piece of \nour energy strategy as we expand our investments into \nadditional forms of carbon-free energy, including nuclear. \nWe’ll continue to evaluate our energy strategy to meet the \nneeds of our customers and achieve our commitment to \nreach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\nLearn more about our approach in our Renewable \nEnergy Methodology    \n•\t Energy storage solutions: We are expanding battery \nenergy storage capacity to support the decarbonization \nof electricity grids.\n•\t Diversifying carbon-free energy sources: In addition to \nwind and solar, we are exploring and investing in other \ncarbon-free energy sources, such as nuclear, that can \nhelp match the electricity consumed by our operations \nfor the long term as our business grows.\n•\t Partnerships and advocacy for carbon-free energy \nsolutions: We engage in partnerships, industry \ninitiatives, and public policy advocacy to advance access \nto and the expansion of carbon-free energy for Amazon, \nour customers, and the communities where we operate. \nAs part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, we set \ntwo renewable energy goals that are central to our broader \ncarbon-free energy approach: to match all the electricity \nconsumed by our operations with 100% renewable energy \nand to invest in wind and solar capacity equal to the \nelectricity used by all active Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices \nworldwide. Additionally, we’re asking our suppliers to use \nmore renewable energy, engaging product and device \nsuppliers to set goals to decarbonize their own operations, \nand working with suppliers on initiatives to reduce their \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. \nWe use broad carbon-free energy options to support our \ncontinued growth, enabling us to deploy and grow new \ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). By scaling \ncarbon-free energy, we aim to make Amazon a more resilient \nand more sustainable business, drive a global transition to \ncleaner energy, and achieve our commitment to The Climate \nPledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. \nCarbon-free energy includes existing renewable energy \ntechnologies, such as wind and solar farms and on-site \nrooftop solar systems, as well as nuclear reactors that \ngenerate carbon-free energy and other sources such as \nhydroelectric and geothermal.

Our total capacity of \nrenewable energy in Europe is now 7 GW, including 1.7 GW \nof renewable energy from offshore wind. Offshore wind \nturbines are an important source of renewable energy due to \nthe volume they produce and their reliability, as winds tend \nto be higher and more consistent at sea. In January 2024, \nAmazon signed a corporate PPA with the low-carbon energy \nand services company ENGIE to increase our share of output \nfrom the Moray West offshore wind farm in Scotland to 473 \nmegawatts (MW) once the site becomes operational in 2024.\nAmazon also accelerated renewable energy investments \nacross the Asia-Pacific region in 2023, including by adding 24 \nnew utility-scale solar and wind projects to our portfolio. We \nunveiled three new utility-scale renewable energy projects in \nIndia, including a 198 MW wind farm in Osmanabad. In China, \nwe announced two new wind farms in Daqing and Bobai. We \nalso invested in new solar projects in Japan, New Zealand, \nand Australia.\nAlong with bringing new renewable energy sources to \nmarket, these solar and wind farm projects generate \neconomic growth in local communities around the world. To \ntrack the benefits that these projects deliver, Amazon \ndeveloped an industry-leading economic model that follows \nguidance from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory and was independently \nvalidated by Oxford Economics. The model estimates the \ninvestment generated by the construction and operation of \nutility-scale solar and wind farms, including direct economic \neffects (hiring and spending by the developer) and indirect \neffects (hiring and spending by suppliers and workers). The \nmodel found that from 2014 through 2022, Amazon’s solar \nand wind farms generated over $12 billion in community \ninvestments around the world and supported 39,000 full-\ntime-equivalent jobs at direct suppliers and at businesses in \nAmazon’s downstream supply chain globally in 2022 alone. \nLearn more about the model in the Economic Impact of \nAmazon Investment in Renewables Methodology \nOn-Site Solar Projects\nIn 2023, 50 new on-site solar energy systems became \noperational at our facilities and stores, adding 58 MW of \ncapacity. Altogether, these solar energy projects generate an \nestimated 123,000 MWh and avoid roughly 47,500 metric \ntons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) each year. \nWe launched our first on-site solar array with energy storage \nprojects in Bakersfield and San Bernardino, California, in \n2023. Additionally, we reached our first on-site solar array \ndeals in Ohio and in Belgium and Saudi Arabia. These \nprojects bring the total number of rooftop solar projects \nacross Amazon and Whole Foods Market facilities to 270, \nwith a total capacity of 344 MW. Altogether, these projects \navoid roughly 17 million metric tons of CO2e each year.\nData Centers Powered with Renewable Energy \nAmazon’s energy supply from utilities, combined with the \nrenewable energy we procure globally, means that 100% of \nthe electricity consumed by 22 AWS data center regions is \nmatched with renewable energy sources—an increase from \n19 regions in 2022.‡\nAcross Amazon, we work with utilities and regulators \non green tariffs so that more companies can buy clean \nenergy directly from renewable energy projects. In eastern \nOregon, for instance, AWS partnered with Umatilla Electric \nCooperative—the utility serving AWS data centers in \nthe area—to create a first-of-its-kind deal structure in \nthe state that allows AWS to directly choose the energy \nsupply powering its data centers, including renewable \nenergy sources.\nAlso in Oregon, Amazon’s investment in the Gilliam County \nwind farm is expected to add capacity by replacing older \nwind turbine blades and equipment with modern technology, \nallowing for more efficient production of wind energy.

Our latest \nprojects include Mississippi’s first utility-scale wind farm \nand multiple solar farms in states such as Arkansas and \nGeorgia. Once fully operational, these projects are expected \nto generate more than 7,500 GWh of renewable energy. We \nalso started producing renewable energy from nearly 5,600 \nrooftop solar panels installed at the Amazon Air Hub at the \nCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. This \npurchaser to invest in renewable energy projects in countries \nsuch as Indonesia, Poland, and South Africa. This led us to \npurchase more renewable energy than any other corporation \nin the world.\nCollectively, these projects represent 28 gigawatts (GW) \nof renewable energy capacity, making Amazon the world’s \nlargest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the \nfourth year in a row. Once operational, these projects are \nexpected to generate more than 77,000 gigawatt-hours \n(GWh) of renewable energy each year—enough energy to \npower 7.3 million homes for a year and an increase of 35% \nfrom 57,000 GWh in 2022. \nIn 2023, we announced investments in more than 100 new \nsolar and wind energy projects, expanded our renewables \nportfolio into 27 countries, including adding projects \nin Canada, Greece, and South Korea, and launched new \nrenewable energy projects in 17 U.S. states.11\n26\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

Brownfields are pieces of land \nthat have been abandoned due to pollution, such as mines, \nfactories, and landfills. The U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency estimates that more than 450,000 brownfields could \nbe revitalized for solar energy projects across the country. \nBrownfields are often located near power lines and public \nroads, making it easier to connect these types of projects to \nthe grid.\nPartnerships and Advocacy for \nCarbon-Free Energy Solutions\nSupporting a More Just, Equitable, and \nSustainable Clean Energy Transition \nAs the world’s largest corporate renewable energy purchaser, \nwe have a unique role to play in supporting a more just, \nequitable, and sustainable clean energy transition. As a \nfounding member and active participant in Beyond the \nMegawatt—an initiative from the Clean Energy Buyers \nAssociation (CEBA)—we are helping scale results-oriented \nclean energy procurement strategies that put energy grid \nresiliency, social equity, and environmental protection \nat the forefront of solar and wind transactions. Beyond \nthe Megawatt partners with energy customers, energy \nand service providers, nongovernmental organizations, \nacademia, researchers, community organizations, and other \nbusinesses to help ensure a diversity of stakeholder voices \nare represented as we shift toward carbon-free energy. \nIn 2023, we participated in CEBA’s equity and resilience \nworking groups, which produced industry-wide guidance \non incorporating biodiversity and social benefit standards \ninto PPAs. \nScaling Up Carbon-Free Energy\nTo advance the transition to carbon-free energy within \nour supply chain, Amazon helped found the Clean Energy \nProcurement Academy (CEPA) with other leading companies \nin 2023. CEPA supports the adoption of clean energy by \nsuppliers through training and online educational resources. \nThe academy’s founding organizations pooled their expertise \nand internal resources to design a shared training curriculum \nand delivery processes. Through our collaborative efforts \nwith fellow members and suppliers, this initiative aims to \nrapidly advance clean energy procurement, address Scope 3 \nemissions, and decarbonize global supply chains.\nWe also co-founded the Emissions First Partnership (EFP), \na coalition of companies committed to modernizing GHG \naccounting standards for the power sector, as part of our \nefforts to decarbonize power grids. Through our work with \nEFP, we have continued to advocate for updated carbon \naccounting guidelines for the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. \nThese revised standards are designed to make carbon \naccounting more closely resemble the real-world carbon \neffects of an organization’s actions. The standards will also \nprovide more opportunities for organizations to invest in \ndecarbonization initiatives such as clean energy projects—\nespecially in markets where there is the ability and resources \nto decarbonize the power system faster.\nLearn more about how we are working to decarbonize our \nsupply chain \nAdvocating for Improved Infrastructure  \nand Policies\nWe have made significant progress in procuring renewable \nenergy for our business, supply chain, and surrounding \ncommunities. However, there are a number of challenges \nto scaling up renewables, including project delays, long \ntimelines due to interconnection queues, and the lack of a \nstrong policy framework.\nSupporting Grid Improvements\nThe widespread transition to carbon-free power requires \nan upgraded and expanded electricity grid. In the U.S., \ninsufficient transmission capacity is gridlocking renewable \nenergy deployment. The demand for renewables is \noverwhelming—projects waiting to get on the grid exceed \nthe system’s overall capacity to support them. With a \ngrowing number of renewable projects in the pipeline, \nadvancing policies and incentives to enable and encourage \nthe much-needed build-out of the transmission system will \nbe vital.\nWe recommended to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) that it require transmission providers to \nconsider a broader array of transmission needs, including \ncorporate commitments for renewable energy procurement. \nIn 2023, we continued our work to require utilities and grid \nDiversifying Carbon-Free Energy Sources\nAs the demand for energy increases around the world, we are \nexpanding our investments in carbon-free energy solutions, \nincluding nuclear. For example, in early 2023, we purchased a \nnuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania that is directly \npowered by the adjacent Susquehanna Steam Electric Station. \nNuclear energy is a strong option that already has a proven \ntrack record of providing a constant source of reliable power \nfor communities around the world. Nuclear energy is the \nmost reliable, abundant, and stable energy source on the \ngrid, and Amazon’s investment in nuclear power is part of \nour broader efforts to decarbonize the energy sector, and \nour business. \nEnergy Storage Solutions\nWe invest in energy storage to collect and save renewable \nenergy for use when other energy sources may be \nunavailable—such as at night or during periods of high \ndemand—and to help improve grid stability. In 2023, we \nadded seven solar projects paired with battery energy \nstorage systems to our portfolio in the U.S. We now hold 1.3 \nGW of storage capacity, up from 445 MW in 2022.\nIn 2023, we announced plans to support the repurposing \nof a previously polluted Maryland coal mine into a solar \nfarm. Amazon Solar Farm Maryland–CPV Backbone is under \nconstruction at the site of the recently closed Arch Coal Mine \nin Garrett County, Maryland. More than 1,100 acres of coal \nrefuse once contaminated this 120-year-old mining site, and \nthis land has since been reclaimed. \nThe project is expected to employ more than 200 skilled \nworkers during peak construction activities and provide \nmillions of dollars in local tax revenue. Once completed, it is \nexpected to be the largest solar farm in Maryland. Featuring \nmore than 326,000 solar panels, Amazon Solar Farm \nMaryland–CPV Backbone will avoid more than 64,000 metric \ntons of CO2e each year—the equivalent of taking more than \n13,900 cars off the road.\n27\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

In 2023, we backed \na new global renewable energy goal, urging world leaders at \nCOP28 to triple renewable energy capacity to at least 11,000 \nGW by 2030.\nIn the U.S., we are focusing on accelerating the addition \nof new renewable energy projects to the grid. In 2023, we \nadvocated for grid planners to be required to prioritize \nprojects that are “ready to be brought online,” instead \nof projects that submitted queue applications first. FERC \nadopted this shift to a “first-ready, first-served” model \nin 2023. We also encouraged the Bonneville Power \nAdministration in the Pacific Northwest to adopt first-\nready, first-served queue reforms, which they did in 2024, \nfacilitating increased production of clean energy across \nthe region. In Ireland, we encouraged the Commission for \nRegulation of Utilities (CRU) to create a pathway for offshore \nwind projects to be delivered through corporate purchasing. \nCRU agreed and extended the timeline for offshore wind \nprojects to be available for corporate buyers such as Amazon.\nBecause permitting for renewable energy projects is one key \nfactor delaying clean energy deployment, we are working \nwith legislators, advocacy organizations, and corporate \npartners to drive permitting efficiencies across Europe and \nhelp reduce delays. In Poland, we called for policymakers \nto loosen restrictions on permitting and locating wind \nprojects as its government works to increase the amount of \nrenewable energy on its grid. As a result of our and others’ \nwork, Poland’s government partially reduced its permitting \nrestrictions in 2023, allowing more renewable energy \nprojects to be developed there.\nIn addition, AWS is collaborating with WindEurope and \nAccenture to develop EasyPermits, a digital permitting \nsolution running on AWS that increased the efficiency of \nthe administrative permitting process, enabling shortened \npermitting timelines to help the EU meet its 2030 \nrenewable energy targets. EasyPermits is a secure web-\nbased cloud solution that addresses key challenges faced \nby permitting agents and project developers to increase \nLooking Forward\nWe remain focused on scaling carbon-free energy across our \ncompany and the communities we operate in. In 2024 and \nbeyond, we will continue to add more carbon-free energy \ngeneration and storage capacity to our portfolio as we scale \nup new technologies such as AI and work toward our goal to \nachieve net-zero carbon by 2040. This will include investing \nin more solar and wind energy projects, such as our Moray \nWest offshore wind farm in Scotland   , and nuclear projects. \nAs we progress toward decarbonizing our business, we will \nalso engage with our partners, industry associations, and \nregulators around the world to scale our work, share what \nwe’ve learned, and advocate for infrastructure and policies \nthat help create a carbon-free energy future. We’ve always \nsaid that the path to net-zero carbon won’t be linear. As with \nany long-term goal, we’ll continue to evolve our strategy \nover time to do what is right for our business and the planet, \nto meet the needs of our customers, and to reach net-zero \ncarbon by 2040.\nAnticipating Future Energy Demand \nPowered by AWS\nAWS is collaborating with Duke Energy, which \noperates the largest electrical grid in the U.S., to \nbuild new smart grid software and services that \nanticipate future energy demand and identify \nwhere and how to update the power grid. By \nrunning on AWS, Duke Energy’s Intelligent Grid \nServices will provide more accurate forecasting \nof electricity needs in a matter of minutes, rather \nthan the weeks it would take with traditional \ninformation technology hardware. This in turn \nenables Duke Energy to make smarter decisions, \nincluding about where to replace equipment \nor implement non-wire alternatives, which \nare electrical grid investments intended to \ndefer or eliminate the need to construct or \nupgrade components.\nthe speed and amount of renewable energy on the grid. \nThis tool is currently available to support onshore wind \nprojects, has been successfully tested in two municipalities \nin Denmark, and will continue to scale to support carbon-\nfree energy policy objectives. Through our Danish pilot, \nEasyPermits reportedly enabled concurrent processing of \nup to three times as many permit applications and delivered \na 50% reduction in administrative workload by improving \ntransparency and information management.\nOur advocacy to scale renewable energy extends around \nthe globe. In Japan, Amazon worked with third-party \norganizations to advocate for virtual PPAs, allowing \ncorporate buyers to increase the number of projects \nthat will be built through their own initiatives. In South \nAfrica, we partnered with the City of Cape Town to pilot a \n“power wheeling” project. Power wheeling uses the city’s \ntransmission or distribution system to distribute energy \nbetween different grids or service areas. As a result of the \npilot, energy customers in the city can now invest in and \naccess renewable energy projects. \nsystem to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future, \nto improve capacity on existing lines and bring renewable \nenergy to the grid at a much lower cost than that of \ntraditional solutions.\nWe continued our advocacy work with U.S. regulators in \n2023 to improve transmission planning, permitting, and \ninterconnection processes, including calling for federal \ntransmission permitting reform in Congress. We also \njoined advocacy groups such as Western Freedom and \nRenewable Northwest in support of their efforts to create \nan organized wholesale electricity market in the western \nU.S. Amazon publicly supported and advocated for SB-410 \n(Powering Up Californians Act), a new law to speed up utility \ninterconnection processes, which passed in the California \nlegislature with bipartisan support and was signed into law \nby the governor. \nplanners to deploy grid-enhancing technologies.

Our aim \nis to continue to increase the number of products shipped \nthrough the program so that we can further reduce our \npackaging use and avoid incremental carbon emissions \nassociated with additional materials and weight.\nAs we focus on shipping more items without additional \ndelivery bags or boxes, we’ve challenged ourselves to ship \nsome of the most complex products without additional \npackaging—such as TVs, glassware, and toys. We are able \nto then use those learnings and apply them to less complex \nproducts that may need only small adjustments to qualify \nfor the Ships in Product Packaging program. As we set new \nstandards required to qualify for the program, we’re also \nable to identify and onboard products that do not need \nany adjustments.\nAmazon works with suppliers to re-engineer their \npackaging   to qualify for the program and expand the \neligibility of products. For example, we worked with Hasbro \nto design a sturdier package for the Hasbro Galactic Heroes \nBB-8 Adventure toy that is 81% smaller, contains 20 \nfewer components, and is eligible for the Ships in Product \nPackaging program.\nTo make sure that our customers are aware of this program, \nwe let them know a product is shipping in its own packaging \nat checkout on Amazon websites in the U.S., Canada, and \nEurope. We also give customers the option to add Amazon \npackaging if desired.\nLearn more about the Ships in Product Packaging \nprogram \nAround the World\nIn 2023, nearly 12 million products qualified for the Ships in \nProduct Packaging program, and 12% of Amazon packages \nglobally were shipped without additional packaging, \nincluding 13% in the U.S. and Canada, 9% in Europe, 3% in \nJapan, 19% in India, and 8% in Brazil, Mexico, and Singapore. \nThis progress is a result of continuing to identify products \nthat qualify for the program, working with selling partners \nto make packaging updates that allow their products \nto ship in their original packaging, and implementing \nregionalization. The last is Amazon’s new delivery approach \nthat utilizes shorter routes across the U.S., expanding \neligibility for products to ship in their own packaging without \nrisking damage.\nLearn more about regionalization \nInspiring Selling Partners to Reduce Packaging\nOur Ships in Product Packaging program doesn’t just offer \nenvironmental benefits. Less packaging also means lower \ncosts, and Amazon believes in sharing these cost savings with \nour selling partners. In 2023, we tested decreasing the cost \nof Fulfillment by Amazon   (FBA) for sellers who adopt the \nprogram.

We think locally, taking into consideration factors \nsuch as location and geography, average delivery distance \nto customers, vehicle type, and delivery method. As we \nregionalize our network, products travel shorter distances \nto customers and need less protective packaging. We move \nquickly to invest in responsible shipping and packaging \ninnovations that can scale our program to ship products \nwithout additional packaging.\nAs we continue to learn and evolve our packaging strategy, \nwe focus on the following priorities:\n•\t We avoid unnecessary packaging whenever possible \nthrough our Ships in Product Packaging program and \nwork with suppliers to re-engineer their packaging to \nqualify for the program.\n•\t When supplemental Amazon packaging is required, \nwe select lighter, right-sized options to reduce our \npackaging footprint while still protecting the item.  \nWe use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize packaging \ntypes—from bags to boxes—and sizes, depending on \nthe level of protection needed.\n•\t We prioritize materials that are household recyclable.

Like \nmost retailers, Amazon has traditionally used a mix of plastic \nand paper packaging to optimize for durability, weight, and \nsize. However, recycling plastic packaging generally requires \ncustomers to visit a drop-off location. To make recycling \nour packaging as easy as possible, our packaging engineers \nhave been researching and experimenting for years to ensure \nwe find the right solutions to deliver more products to \ncustomers with household-recyclable paper.\nThese packaging reduction initiatives have made a significant \nimpact, decreasing our average plastic packaging weight per \nshipment by 9% across Amazon’s global operations network, \nbuilding on a 17% reduction in 2022. Altogether, we have \navoided 80,500 metric tons of single-use plastic packaging \nsince 2020. Efforts so far include our Ships in Product \nPackaging program, leveraging AI to identify where we can \nuse lighter, more flexible, right-sized packaging, replacing \nsingle-use plastic delivery packaging with 100% household-\nrecyclable paper and cardboard packaging in our fulfillment \nnetwork in Europe, and eliminating single-use, thin-film \nplastic packaging from our fulfillment network in India.15 \nWhile these reduction initiatives have slowed our plastic \npackaging use, our total plastic packaging increased 3% from \n86,055 metric tons in 2022 to 88,698 metric tons in 2023 \ndue to our business growth.16\nAdditionally, in October 2023, we announced our first \nautomated U.S. fulfillment center to eliminate plastic \ndelivery packaging as part of our multi-year effort to \neliminate plastic delivery packaging from our North America \nfulfillment centers. In June 2024, we announced a major \nmilestone for this effort, removing 95% of plastic air pillows \nfrom delivery packaging in North America, working toward \nfull removal by end of year. This will avoid the use of nearly \n15 billion plastic air pillows annually and will be our largest \nplastic packaging reduction effort in North America to date. \nWe will continue to build and test new innovations and \nimprove on the systems we have in place in order to decrease \nour use of single-use plastic packaging and share updates on \nthe progress we’re making.\nWhile recycling infrastructure varies around the world, \nwe remain dedicated to designing packaging that is easier \nto recycle where such programs exist, while considering \nlocalized, country-specific challenges and how to solve them \nas part of our ongoing approach.\nEurope\nIn 2023, we announced that 100% of delivery packaging \nin Europe—the boxes, bags, and envelopes needed to get \nproducts to customers—was household recyclable, including \nfor items sold by Amazon and third-party selling partners \nthat use FBA. In total, 87 European fulfillment centers have \nstopped using plastic packaging for deliveries. \nUnited States and Canada\nIn 2023, we expanded our use of household-recyclable \npaper-padded bags across the U.S. and Canada, \nreplacing 99.7% of padded bags containing both plastic and \npaper. This change has helped us avoid nearly 41,600 metric \ntons of single-use plastic since 2020. We also transitioned 13 \nfulfillment centers from plastic to paper for dunnage, the \ndurable packing material used to protect goods during \nshipping. Furthermore, we are investing in research and \ndevelopment to identify better paper alternatives for the rest \nof our packaging suite.\nIndia, Japan, and Rest of World \nSince Amazon replaced thin-film single-use plastic packaging \nmaterial with paper- and cardboard-based packaging across \nour India fulfillment network in 2019, we have avoided \na total of 9,100 metric tons of plastic packaging in the \ncountry. In addition, 100% of delivery packaging material is \nhousehold recyclable in India as of the end of 2023.\nIn Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab \nEmirates, Amazon stopped using dunnage, including air \npillows, in most boxes. When we do still need to use dunnage \nto secure products during shipping, we’re increasing our \nuse of packaging made with recycled materials. For larger \nshipments that require dunnage, we are working toward \nreplacing air pillows with paper alternatives. \nIn Japan, 99.5% of delivery packaging material is household \nrecyclable as of the end of 2023. We anticipate that all sites \nin this country will participate in this program by the end \nof 2024. In 2023, Amazon removed plastic shrink-wrap film \nand replaced plastic cushioning materials, such as air pillows, \n32\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

We \nexpanded this practice to Australia in 2023.\nMinimizing and Optimizing \nPackaging in Grocery\nTo make sure groceries ordered from Amazon and Whole \nFoods Market arrive in good condition, we look for ways to \nprotect products during delivery while still minimizing our \npackaging footprint.\nIn 2023, Amazon Fresh reduced our use of insulation \npackaging material, which avoided approximately 1,180 \nmetric tons of packaging. Similarly, Whole Foods Market \navoided 1,300 metric tons of packaging by using daily \nvariable insulation, a practice that tracks and adjusts the \namount of insulation packaging used in deliveries in North \nAmerica to ensure it is used only when temperatures exceed \na specific threshold. \nGroceries are also being delivered in packaging that is easier \nto recycle. In 2023, the grocery delivery packaging used by \nAmazon Fresh was 88% recyclable by weight.\nWhole Foods Market published an updated version of \nits Packaging Guidelines in 2023 to help merchants, \nprocurement teams, and suppliers understand how to make \nmore sustainable choices for product packaging. In alignment \nwith the Whole Foods Market Sustainability Strategy, these \nguidelines are meant to reduce the amount of packaging it \nuses, improve the source material, and design for end-of-\nlife and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Smarter \npackaging choices can also help reduce food waste and \ndivert packaging waste from landfills. Whole Foods Market’s \nPackaging Guidelines are grounded in four core concepts (or \n”Principles“) aimed at balancing safety, performance, and \nIncreasing the Recyclability of \nDevice Packaging\nAmazon’s strategy to optimize and increase the recyclability \nof packaging extends to our devices. In 2020, we set \nan ambitious goal to make our device packaging 100% \nrecyclable by 2023—a first for the consumer electronics \nindustry. To work toward this goal, we collaborated with \nour suppliers to develop paper-based wraps and films that \nprotect devices and are compatible with paper recycling \nstreams. These paper-based wraps are recyclable in the U.S. \nwhere recycling programs are available.\nIn 2023, 90% of our new devices and accessories launched \nwith packaging that is 100% recyclable in the U.S., up from \n79% in 2022. We have made significant progress, but we \nhave not yet created recyclable packaging for heavier items, \nsuch as Fire TVs. The box for Fire TVs is recyclable, but we \nstill include foam cushioning and bags to protect the device \nwhen it is shipped, and these are not yet recyclable. Amazon \nremains committed to using recyclable device packaging and \nto inventing recyclable solutions for heavier items, such as \nFire TVs, that properly protect the device while maintaining \nour high bar for quality.\nsustainability: material safety, material performance and \nefficiency, design for recovery, and source responsibly.\nWe use paper-based wraps and films where we can to avoid plastic in \nour device packaging.\nPartnerships to Improve \nPackaging Materials, Circularity, \nand Recycling\nAmazon works hard to reduce plastic packaging across our \ndeliveries. However, in some cases, the right technologies and \nmaterials do not yet exist to adequately protect orders from \nphysical damage or in specific weather conditions. To find \nalternatives that are waterproof, flexible, and safe enough \nfor e-commerce deliveries and product packaging, our \nscientists continue to collaborate with others to accelerate \nthe innovation, deployment, and scaling of new lower-carbon \nand lower-waste materials.\nUnited States\nWe partner with industry peers and expert organizations, \nsuch as the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, to improve \nrecycling infrastructure. Amazon also works with The \nRecycling Partnership (TRP) to help launch recycling \nprograms in communities across the U.S. Our 2023 \ninvestment helped TRP start recycling programs that reached \nmore than 36,000 households and recycled 1 million pounds \nof materials.\nGlobal\nTogether with Novamont, an Italy-based biomaterials \ncompany, Amazon is testing new ways to collect and recycle \nbio-based and biodegradable materials, such as non-\ngenetically modified corn starch and vegetable oils. We \nco-invented an innovative recycling technology with the \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory through the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy’s BOTTLE Consortium, creating an \nentirely circular loop for these materials.18 In 2023, we piloted \nthis solution in Italy and Spain and plan to use the learnings \nto improve the technology for future use. \nWe also joined the Global Organization for PHA (GO!PHA) \nin 2023. This coalition is working to drive the transition to \na circular economy in which pollution-free alternatives to \nplastic are used in materials for packaging, single-use, and \ndurable applications. Amazon contributes to various GO!PHA \nworking groups, including Science & Technology and Policy, \nand collaborates on policy advocacy efforts.\nIn 2022, we became a member of the Australian Packaging \nCovenant Organisation (APCO), a nonprofit group leading \nthe development of a circular economy for packaging in \nAustralia. Along with setting the country’s 2025 national \npackaging targets, APCO works to foster a collaborative \npackaging value chain in Australia.\nWe support the European Commission’s goal to tackle \nexcessive packaging via legislation such as the EU Packaging \nand Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR). In Europe, we \ncontinue to improve our packaging using a science-based \napproach and will further reduce our environmental impact \nby investing in new materials, processes, and technologies \nthat drive void and materials reduction at scale.\nLooking Forward\nWe remain committed to enhancing our packaging for both \nperformance and sustainability. We will continue working to \nreduce our packaging footprint by increasing uptake of the \nShips in Product Packaging program, leveraging machine \nlearning and other innovative technologies to optimize \npackaging size and shape, and transitioning to more circular \npackaging materials instead of single-use plastics. In fact, in \nFebruary 2024, we announced that nearly 50% of customer \norders from our India fulfillment network now come \nwith reduced or no added packaging  . We will also keep \nprioritizing our engagement with selling partners and larger-\nscale coalitions to accelerate collective progress. \n33\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

    "text": "Our Approach\nOur waste hierarchy sets out our guiding principles for \npreventing, managing, and reducing waste. Amazon has \nprograms in place to optimize our inventory, reduce food \nsurplus, and source materials that help us prevent waste in \nthe first place. Where possible, we look for ways to reduce, \nreuse, recycle, or compost these materials.\nWe work hard to make it easy for customers to discover \nproducts they love. They usually do, but just like with any \nretailer, sometimes customers want to return something \nthat they purchased from us. If customers do need to \nreturn something, Amazon strives to give items a second \nlife through resale, donation, or recycling—in that order of \npriority. Returned items undergo inspection to determine \nwhether they can be resold. We aim to donate items that \ncannot be sold, but when they are not suitable for sale, \nresale, or donation, often due to damage or expiration, we \nprioritize their recycling. \nWe amplify our efforts by considering how customers use \nour products through end-of-life and by providing them \nwith opportunities to repair or resell products. Our circular \napproach keeps valuable resources in use longer, avoiding \nwaste and reducing related effects such as carbon emissions \nand pollution. \nWe know that avoiding waste is an ongoing process and \nthat we cannot do it on our own. We engage with suppliers \nto reduce waste related to our products, partner with other \norganizations to scale our efforts to transition to a more \ncircular economy, and work with local municipalities to \nimprove recycling infrastructure where we can. \nPrevent\nWe improve product and packaging design, inventory management, materials \nsourcing, and resource use to prevent waste from the start. \nReduce\nWe pursue avenues such as increased product durability and resale to reduce waste. \nWe also work to prevent waste generation by helping customers make informed \ndecisions, which reduces product returns, and offer several ways for them to \nsupport product circularity.\nIncineration with Energy Recovery\nWhere prevention, reduction, reuse, or recycling are not possible, we target \nenergy recovery.\nRecycle\nWe recycle and compost to recover raw materials where possible, including  \nfood waste.\nLandfill and Incineration without Energy Recovery\nBoth landfill and incineration without energy recovery are disposal methods \nstrictly used as a last resort for waste that is either ineligible for or cannot be \ndiverted to better recovery pathways.22\nReuse\nWe repair, repurpose, and donate usable items where possible.\nOur Approach to Managing and \nPreventing Waste\nThis hierarchy is an industry framework that guides our \napproach to managing and preventing waste. It moves \nfrom the most preferred option at the top to the least \npreferred at the bottom. Materials in this hierarchy may \nbe recycled, reclaimed, or otherwise reused in some \nway and thus may not end up as waste in landfills. \nWe use this framework to better manage our waste, \npursuing opportunities that are more preferred before \nmoving down the hierarchy.\n35\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

    "text": "Our Progress\nPreventing and Managing Waste\nThe waste we generate falls into two categories: internal and \nexternal. Internal waste is generated inside our operations, \nwhile external waste is generated both upstream and \ndownstream of our operations, such as by suppliers and \ncustomers. Some of these items are diverted from waste \nstreams by our prevention efforts, recycling programs, and \nother initiatives to reduce waste.\nOur internal (direct) waste footprint includes:\n•\t Operations: Operational waste is the type of waste that \nwe can most directly control. We manage operational \nwaste generated across our business, including from \nour grocery stores and other retail sites, customer \nfulfillment operations, office buildings, and data centers. \nWaste from our internal operations falls into two \ncategories: \n•\t Inventory waste includes heavily damaged and \nunsold items, customer returns that cannot be \nresold, donated, or recycled, and food that is no \nlonger safe for consumption.\n•\t Noninventory waste is made up of resources that \nare used and discarded within our businesses. These \nmaterials enable our operations but are not directly \npart of the inventory of finished goods or materials \nused to produce them. Noninventory waste includes \nmaterials such as used cardboard boxes, shrink wrap, \nelectronic waste, break room waste, used office \nfurniture, and damaged storage equipment.\nFood Waste\nIn the U.S., nearly 98% of Amazon’s food handled goes \nto human and animal consumption, and in Europe, more \nthan 99% does. While these figures are encouraging, we \nare always exploring new ways to reduce food loss and \nwaste as we work toward our goal to reduce our food waste \nby 50% across our U.S. and Europe operations by 2030. \nThis commitment is reflective of our membership in the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Food Loss and \nWaste 2030 Champions  , which we joined in 2020. We \nthen extended our commitment to reducing food waste to \nour Europe operations in 2021. We measure our progress \nagainst this commitment with a food waste intensity \nmetric that calculates the amount of food waste generated \nas a percentage of total food handled by weight within \nAmazon. As of December 2023, our food waste intensity \nhad decreased by 28% in the U.S. and by 75% in Europe \ncompared to a 2021 baseline.\nTo reduce food waste, we are improving our management \nand distribution channels and buying practices to minimize \nsurplus food inventory. In 2023, we enhanced buying and \nIn 2023, we improved our ability to gather accurate, timely, \nand robust data. This allows us to enhance waste tracking \nand management as our business changes and as we add \nnew sites and onboard waste vendors. One enabler of this \nprogress was the creation of a central data collection tool \nthat provides a single, companywide repository for internal \nwaste data from our operations and activities. We also built a \nprototype forecasting tool to help us predict and plan for the \nfuture. We will continue to build these processes and tools \nthroughout 2024.\nOur external (indirect) waste footprint includes the \nfollowing areas:\n•\t Customer waste is generated during product use or in \nthe form of product and delivery packaging, including \nwhen disposed of. Beyond the work we do to help \ncustomers keep items in use longer, we also offer \nseveral ways for them to support product circularity \nand prevent waste through our Amazon Second Chance \nprogram.\n•\t Construction waste comes from activities related \nto building our facilities. This consists mainly of \ncommingled construction and demolition waste such as \nmetals, masonry, asphalt, and drywall.\n•\t Supply chain waste is generated by third-party suppliers \nwho manufacture products for, and provide goods and \nservices to, our company.\ndistribution channels for Amazon sites in the U.S. and \nEurope. We also work to reduce our surplus by offering \ndiscounts on items at risk of becoming waste. In 2023, we \ncontinued to improve our food-discounting technology so \nmore food items are sold to customers. Amazon Fresh online \nlaunched a program in the UK, Germany, Spain, and Italy to \nsell items with reduced shelf life at a discount. On average, \n65% of that discounted inventory ends up in the hands of \ncustomers. A similar program exists for Amazon Fresh stores \nin the U.S. Programs like these not only help our customers \nfind food items at a lower price, but also contribute to our \nambition to reduce food waste. We also donate surplus food \nitems to local food banks and food rescue organizations. \nLearn more about how we are donating surplus food items \nto those who need them most \nWhere food waste is not preventable, we are working to keep \nit out of landfills. As of the end of 2023, 62 Amazon Fresh \nstores in the U.S. and Europe divert food waste to organic \nrecycling services, including those that support composting \nor anaerobic digestion. In 2023, 452 Whole Foods Market \nlocations had active organics diversion programs, which \ndiverted over 87,000 tons of food waste from landfill. \nWe also advocate for policies that would help prevent \nusable food from being wasted. In 2023, Amazon and Whole \nFoods Market supported the U.S. Food Date Labeling Act \nbecause confusion around food expiration date labeling \ncan result in usable food being unnecessarily thrown out. \nOur engagement included advocating to Congress for \nstandardizing and clarifying expiration date labels on food \nas part of a coalition led by the World Wildlife Fund and the \nZero Food Waste Coalition.\nIn November 2023, we opened a pop-up Second Chance Store in London, \nwhere customers could shop second-hand products from Amazon.\n36\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

    "text": "As we continue on our journey to reduce waste—\nincluding our commitment to reduce food waste \nby 50% in our U.S. and Europe operations by \n2030—we are exploring different ways to learn \nand grow. As of the end of 2023, four Amazon \nFresh facilities had achieved UL’s Zero Waste to \nLandfill certification at Silver or Gold level.\nWe secured this certification by improving \noperational waste sorting processes, standardizing \nrecycling practices at all sites, introducing new \nassociate trainings, and establishing new diversion \npathways, including for food waste. Through the \ncertification process, we learned new ways of \nworking and identified potential opportunities for \nAmazon. We are excited to leverage what we have \nlearned to improve our overall waste footprint.\nUnlocking New Insights through \nContinuous Learning\nIn November 2023, Amazon opened a pop-up \nSecond Chance Store in central London, where \nshoppers could buy quality returned, refurbished, \nand open-box items in-person. More than 6,500 \nshoppers visited our store, browsing for kitchen \nand household appliances, books, games and toys, \nelectronics, and more. While the physical Second \nChance Store was temporary, customers can \nbenefit from our Second Chance program online \nyear-round.\nAmazon Second Chance Store\nReducing and Managing Inventory \nand Customer Waste \nPrevent \nWhen it comes to product inventory, our priority is to \nprevent waste, both by helping customers make more \ninformed shopping decisions—which helps reduce customer \nreturns—and by reducing the number of products damaged \nin handling. \nReducing customer returns: We want our customers to be \nable to use the product they ordered with the quality level \nthey expect. Our Product Lifecycle Support (PLS) program \nprovides support options for customers to get the most out \nof their purchase for eligible products. As of the end of 2023, \nAmazon’s PLS program offered three free post-purchase \ncare options: original equipment manufacturer (OEM) \nsupport and OEM repair, where customers can go straight \nto the manufacturer for support; Self Service, which helps \ncustomers address issues themselves; and parts replacement, \nwhere customers can request available components to \nreplace damaged or missing parts, free of charge. In 2023, \nthe PLS program helped avoid the return of more than 11 \nmillion items in the U.S. and Europe, up 50% from 2022. \nAmazon Private Brands also launched a spare parts and \nrepair program in Europe in 2023.\nWe have learned that customers are more likely to keep an \napparel item when a size is recommended for them. That \nis why we developed a deep learning-based algorithm to \nrecommend, in real time, the best-fitting size for a customer. \nIn 2023, our size recommendation system analyzed over \n500 million data points every day and generated nearly \n3 billion size recommendations each month for millions of \ncustomers across 19 countries around the world, including \nthe U.S., India, and the UK.\nLearn more about our artificial intelligence (AI)-driven \nsize recommendations \nReducing damage: We work hard to ensure our customers do \nnot receive products that have been damaged in handling or \nduring transportation. In 2023, we established a specialized \nteam to analyze instances of damage across our global \nwarehouse operations. Analyzing this data at a global level \nidentified opportunities to implement technology and \nprocess changes to reduce damages. The resulting global \nwarehouse damage-reduction plan led to a 21% decrease \nin damage intensity (how many products are damaged for \nevery product we handle) worldwide in 2023. \nReduce and Reuse\nWhere possible, we give inventory a second life. We repair \nor resell items whenever possible and help our sellers do \nthe same. \nReducing overstock: Before we remove overstock from \nour inventory, we try to sell it at a deep discount on our \nAmazon Outlet storefront. When we cannot sell these items, \ninventory is returned to vendors or sold to wholesalers to be \noffered on secondary markets.\nRepair and resell: We carefully inspect and evaluate all \nreturned and undelivered items at our Amazon return \ncenters. If returned items meet Amazon’s high bar for sale as \nnew, we re-list them. \nFor items that are not eligible for re-listing as new but meet \nAmazon’s standards to be sold as used, we (or our specialized \nrepair vendors) test, clean, repair, and repackage them prior \nto re-listing the item for sale. We continue to expand our \nrepair capabilities, repairing 24% more products worldwide \nin 2023 than in 2022. Amazon customers viewing items listed \nfor sale as used will see a condition (e.g., Like New, Very \nGood, Good, Acceptable) and reason(s) for the condition (e.g., \nmissing a user manual, cosmetic damage), allowing them to \nmake the appropriate purchasing decision. \nLearn more about how Amazon manages returns \nAmazon Second Chance: Our Amazon Second Chance \nprogram helps customers give their items a second life. For \nexample, Amazon Trade-In lets customers trade in thousands \nof qualifying Amazon or non-Amazon devices in the U.S., the \nUK, and Germany for a gift card or promotional discount. \nWhen customers buy a pre-owned device, it extends that \nitem’s life, reducing e-waste and raw material extraction. In \n2023, customers traded in over 1 million devices. Amazon \ndevices that are traded in by customers are evaluated to \ndetermine their condition. Some undergo refurbishment, \nand those that meet our quality bar for resale may be sold as \nAmazon Certified Refurbished devices   or as used through \nAmazon Warehouse  .\nLearn more about Amazon Trade-In \nReCommerce for Amazon sellers: When returned items \nare not eligible for resale as new or used, those items \nare returned to sellers, liquidated, donated, or recycled. \nReCommerce is the selling of previously owned items \nto buyers who reuse, recycle, or resell them. We provide \nReCommerce services to Amazon sellers by grading their \nreturned items and enabling recovery through programs \nsuch as grade and resell, liquidation, or donation. In \n2023, we helped sellers resell, liquidate, or donate nearly \n368 million of their items in the U.S. and Europe, a 42% \nincrease compared to 2022.\nDonation: We donate items that are safe to use but remain \nin our inventory after we try to reuse, resell, or repair them. \nIn 2023, we donated or helped our sellers donate over \n162 million items worldwide.\nRecycle\nInventory that is not resold or donated may still be used, \nreused, or reclaimed through our inventory recycling \nprogram.

Where possible, we \nReducing and Managing \nNoninventory Waste \nNoninventory waste is made up of the materials we use \nto run our businesses, including cardboard packaging, \nshipping pallets, plastic stretch film, and paper labels. Our \ngoal is to segregate these materials as much as possible so \nthey can be more easily recycled. Cardboard is one of our \nlargest noninventory waste streams, so we work closely \nwith third-party recycling partners, including the companies \nthat we source our cardboard packaging from, to recycle \nthese materials. \nIn 2023, we:\n•\t Improved our ability to collect and consolidate \nwaste data from our vendors. This gives us a better \nunderstanding of our footprint and has allowed us to \nidentify opportunities to increase waste diversion rates \nacross our complex business. \n•\t Increased our rate of operational waste diverted from \ndisposal, placing emphasis on recycling and composting.\n•\t Expanded our recycling efforts to include hard-to-\nrecycle materials such as adhesive label backing, bulk \ncargo bags, and even personal protective equipment \n(such as masks and gloves).\n•\t Replaced single-use cardboard shipping containers with \nreusable outbound carts to reduce cardboard waste at \ncertain sites.\nLearn more about our partnerships to improve recycling \nways to recycle new types of materials. The result of \nsuccessfully using, reusing, or reclaiming inventory via our \nrecycling program is diversion of these inventory items from \nlandfills and incineration.  \nIf a customer’s device is not eligible for our Amazon Trade-\nIn program, the Amazon Recycling Program provides the \ncustomer with a shipping label to send their device to be \nrecycled and safely disposed of at a licensed recycling facility.\nAWS Circular Economy\nAWS embraces circular economy principles for its server \nracks by designing reusable and lower-carbon rack systems \nfrom the outset. In addition, AWS works to keep equipment \noperating efficiently and to recover value from securely \ndecommissioned equipment through reuse, repair, and \nrecycling. By working to maximize resource value for as long \nas possible, AWS reduces waste generation from its global \noperations, decreases the use of raw materials, and reduces \ncarbon emissions across its supply chain. \nDesign Better\nFor its server racks, AWS concentrates on avoiding excess \nmaterial such as steel or plastic, increasing recycled and bio-\nbased content, and planning for repair, reuse, and recycling \nfrom the beginning. AWS has worked with suppliers to \nrequire that plastic parts of server racks launched since July \n2023 contain at least 30% recycled or bio-based plastic. In \n2023, AWS began to transition to plastic containing recycled \nand bio-based content in parts including air ducts, power \ndistribution board covers, card holders, solid state drive (SSD) \ncarriers/cages, riser brackets, latches, and trays. The carbon \nfootprint of these plastic parts is up to 14% lower than that \nof older platforms with only virgin content. AWS is also \nworking to use steel from electric arc furnaces, which use \nscrap steel in rack enclosures, increasing the recycled content \nfrom 10% to 90%. \nOperate Longer\nWhen AWS uses equipment for as long as operationally \nefficient, it reduces the carbon footprint associated with \nmanufacturing and using new hardware and avoids \nunnecessary waste. In February 2024, AWS announced \nthat the average expected server lifetime had improved \nfrom five to six years. AWS also successfully completed a \nproof of concept that extends the lifespan of S3 hard disk \ndrives (HDDs) by up to two years. This program consolidates \nindividual functional drives from multiple aging racks \ninto fewer, fully functional racks (see the figure, right, on \nhard drive consolidation). This consolidation means AWS \nmoves from powering and cooling a greater number of \naging racks to fewer racks with optimized utility, saving \nwater and energy. Additionally, as a result of consolidation, \nAWS sends only the broken drives for recycling, avoiding \nearly retirement of healthy and working hard drives on \nthe same rack. AWS sends the decommissioned rack to a \nreverse logistics hub for reuse assessment. In 2023, this \nprogram prevented the purchase of over 8,100 new hard \ndrives, avoiding associated carbon emissions and costs while \nalso increasing capacity efficiency. This program is now \noperational and AWS expects it to grow, avoiding even more \ncarbon emissions in the future. \nRecover More\nWhen it is time for server racks to be decommissioned, AWS \nremoves all customer data through secure and thorough \nsanitation processes. AWS then sends retired infrastructure \nhardware from around the world to its regional reverse \nlogistics hubs. These hubs help AWS consolidate, assess, \nrepair, and recirculate functional equipment back into its \ninventory or to third parties to be sold for reuse. They also \nenable AWS to optimize component reuse across its data \ncenters, taking decommissioned equipment from one facility \nand redeploying it to serve demand elsewhere. In 2023, \nAWS expanded its reverse logistics global square footage \nand capacity by making investments in three additional \nsites located in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. The added \nscale and enhanced capabilities provide global coverage \nfor AWS’s decommissioned server and network hardware \nto be tested, repaired, reused, or recycled. As a result, in \n2023, 14.6 million hardware components were diverted from \nlandfills by being recycled or sold into the secondary market \nfor reuse.\n38\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

    "text": "Looking Forward\nReducing waste across Amazon is an ongoing journey. We \nwill strive to advance our work across our waste hierarchy to \nprevent waste, and we’ll continue scaling waste reduction \nand product circularity programs. Doing so in a manner that \ncan keep up with the pace at which resource use is growing \nwill require adopting new technologies that enable us to \nmake progress more quickly and at a larger scale. In 2024, \nThe Climate Pledge Fund invested in Glacier   , a company \nusing AI-powered robots to automate the sorting of \nrecyclables and collect real-time data on recycling streams. \nThis technology helps recycling centers sort materials more \neffectively so that recyclable items stay out of landfills. We \nare also excited to collaborate with Glacier on a pilot project \nto sort novel biomaterials, which would enable recycling for \nmaterials that currently cannot be reused. \nSupply Chain Waste\nAmazon works with suppliers to reduce waste related to the \nmanufacture of our devices. For example, our devices teams \nengage suppliers to decrease waste and material use as part \nof our work to encourage more efficient manufacturing. As \nof 2023, 42 supplier sites of Amazon devices had achieved \nUL’s Zero Waste to Landfill certification at Silver or better, \nan increase from 10 supplier sites when we first launched \nthe program in 2021. All final assembly sites worldwide and \nall China-based packaging sites for Echo, Kindle, Fire tablet, \nFire TV devices, cables, and adapters have also secured Zero \nWaste to Landfill certification at Silver or better.\nLearn more about our efforts to improve the sustainability \nof our devices \nPartnering for Circularity\nWe cannot solve all the challenges that underpin the broader \nshift to a circular economy alone, so we are working with \nmultiple industry partners to innovate and bring about \nchange at scale. \nIn 2023, we expanded our collaboration with the Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation to drive scalable, industry-wide \nsolutions for a circular economy. As a Strategic Partner of \nthe Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network, which is dedicated \nto creating a circular economy, we work to leverage our \nreach, technology, and innovation capabilities and the \nfoundation’s subject-matter expertise to launch and scale \ncircular economy solutions. This collaboration focuses on \ncertifications for products with circular features, providing \ncustomers with the information they need to make more \ncircular choices. These certifications will also encourage \nbrands, OEMs, suppliers, retailers, and e-commerce \nplatforms to create products that are designed in accordance \nwith circular economy principles.\nLearn more about the certifications offered through our \nClimate Pledge Friendly program for products with circular \nfeatures \nWe also collaborated with WRAP (Waste and Resources \nAction Programme   ) in the UK to support innovation and \nimprovement in the recycling industry. Our collaboration \nstrives to transform recycling into a system that emphasizes \nrecycled material quality and supports end markets for \nrecycled output. We also launched the second Amazon \nSustainability Accelerator   in Europe. This program \nprovides workshops, mentorship, and training to startups \nin the circularity space that are developing new recycling \ntechnologies or more sustainable products.\nAdvocating for Waste Shipment \nEfficiency \nIn 2023, we co-led an industry effort to streamline and \nmodernize waste shipment procedures, so that waste \nmaterials reach destinations with the best possible \nsustainability outcomes, including increased and more \nefficient recovery of critical raw materials. The Basel \nConvention on the Control of Transboundary Movements \nof Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal requires the \norigin country, any transit countries, and the destination \ncountry to approve certain shipments of waste. This \nprocess, known as prior informed consent (PIC), can be \ncomplex, time-consuming, and burdensome for under-\nreuse items such as furniture to reduce our waste generation \nat the decommissioning stage. We also leverage contractual \nagreements to help ensure contractors manage construction \nwaste in accordance with both Amazon’s high standards and \nexternal legal requirements.\nThe construction project to build our second headquarters \nin Arlington, Virginia, which opened in 2023, diverted 82% \nof all construction waste (over 17,000 tons) from landfills, \nincluding concrete, drywall, metals, wood, cardboard, \nand plastic.\nLearn more about how we are making our buildings \nmore sustainable \nresourced governments. In many countries, PIC documents \nare mainly transmitted by post, fax, and email. We are \nworking with other industry stakeholders and international \nnongovernmental organizations to develop an electronic PIC \npilot project in the Asia-Pacific region. An expedited, reliable \nPIC process would allow controlled wastes to move more \nefficiently to countries with capacity for environmentally \nsound management of waste and maximum resource \nrecovery potential.  \nAdditionally, we supported industry efforts to maintain a \nclear framework for distinguishing between cross-border \nshipments of waste electrical and electronic equipment \n(WEEE) and used electrical and electronic equipment \n(UEEE). This will protect flows of valuable UEEE to and from \ncountries with the capacity to extend the life of products and \npromote product reuse.\nThe Climate Pledge Fund invested in Glacier, a company using AI to divert recyclable materials, such as aluminum soda cans and cardboard \nboxes, from landfills.\n39\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

    "text": "Our Approach\nOur Progress\nWater Positive in Data Centers\nIn 2022, AWS announced its commitment to being water \npositive by 2030. To meet this goal, AWS is delivering on \nfour strategies:\n•\t Water use effectiveness: AWS is continually working to \noptimize its water consumption and aims to improve its \noverall WUE by reducing how much incoming water it \nuses. AWS uses cloud technologies such as Internet of \nThings (IoT) to analyze real-time water use and identify \nleaks.\n•\t Using more sustainable sources: AWS strives to use \nsustainable water sources, such as recycled water and \nharvested rainwater, where possible. Using recycled \nwater for data center cooling preserves valuable drinking \nwater for communities.\n•\t Reusing cooling water in communities: Data centers \nuse non-contact cooling water to keep our servers from \noverheating. AWS finds ways to return the water to \nthe community, including conveying the water to third \nparties for use in irrigation.\n•\t Delivering water replenishment: AWS invests in water \nreplenishment projects in the communities where it \noperates. These projects expand community water \naccess, availability, and quality by restoring watersheds \nand bringing clean water, sanitation, and hygiene \nservices to water-stressed communities.\nAt the end of 2023, AWS was 41% of the way toward \nachieving its water positive goal. AWS measures progress \nagainst this goal annually by adding together reused \nwater and water from replenishment projects and dividing \nthat number by total water withdrawal minus water from \nsustainable sources. \nIn addition to reporting overall progress, AWS measures \nand tracks two other important water metrics: WUE for \nits data centers and the number of projects contributing \nto its water positive goal. At the end of 2023, AWS had 15 \nreplenishment projects in 10 countries and 26 data centers \nusing more sustainable water sources.\nIn 2023, AWS used its water footprint analysis to inform \nwhere and how it can use more sustainable water sources \n(including recycled water and harvested rainwater), \nimprove WUE, expand water reuse, and grow water \nreplenishment investments. \nAWS works toward its water positive goal through cross-\nteam collaboration, with input from civil and environmental \nengineers, data center operations specialists, and water \nstewardship experts.\nLearn more about how AWS calculates its progress using its \nWater Positive Methodology   \nWater Use Effectiveness\nAWS minimizes water use by using real-time data to identify \nleaks, piloting new treatment technologies, and exploring a \nrange of operational changes, such as installing sensors and \nalerts to track water use and detect anomalies. \nGlobal teams deploy water monitoring technology in AWS \ndata centers to determine where they need to take action to \nmaintain or improve WUE. In 2023, AWS installed thousands \nof sensors in its data centers to track water use. Automatic \nalerts inform AWS of any anomalies so that operators can \ninvestigate in near-real time. AWS also invested in on-site \nwater treatment systems that remove scale-forming minerals \nand allow AWS to recycle more water on-site and minimize \nthe water consumed for cooling. These technologies helped \nWe take a proactive approach to water stewardship, \nanalyzing our footprint, driving operational resilience, and \nbuilding more efficient systems that reduce our impact on \nlocal water sources. Our global water use includes water used \nin both our direct operations and wider supply chain. \nWithin our direct operations, we use water in the \nfollowing ways:\n•\t AWS data centers: Water is an essential resource for \nAWS. AWS primarily uses it to cool its global data \ncenters, which give customers continuous access to AWS \ntechnologies. As a leader in water use effectiveness \n(WUE) among cloud providers, AWS aims to do its part \nto help solve water scarcity challenges. That is why \nit has set a goal to become water positive by 2030, \nmeaning it will return more water to communities and \nthe environment than its direct operations use. Through \nthis goal, AWS is focused on reducing overall water \nwithdrawal and replenishing water in basins facing water \nscarcity located in communities around data centers.\n•\t Water use and replenishment across Amazon: For \nother water-intensive Amazon facilities, including \nlogistics, grocery, and corporate office sites, we \nconcentrate abatement efforts on regions with the \nhighest risk of water scarcity based on their climates \nand watershed conditions. Our logistics buildings \n(fulfillment centers, sort centers, and delivery stations) \nand corporate offices use water in break rooms, kitchens, \nbathrooms, and for landscape irrigation. Our grocery \nstores (Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market) also \nuse water for these purposes, as well as to cook, clean, \nand defrost food; in water refill stations; and as ice in \nproduct displays.\nWe track our progress by measuring and analyzing our direct \noperational water footprint. Since our different businesses \nuse water in different ways, and water risk varies significantly \nacross geographies, the aim of our data insights is to design \na water program that we can tailor to specific needs across \nour company. This enables us to better forecast future \nwater demand, determine the best ways to conserve water, \nand create more efficient systems that will benefit local \nwatersheds over time.\nWater Risk Assessment\nIn 2023, Amazon conducted an in-depth, site-level global \nwater risk assessment of our retail, operations, and corporate \nbuildings to determine which regions to prioritize for \nintervention. We ranked regions by looking at their intrinsic \nwater scarcity based on hazards such as water stress, \ngroundwater table decline, and variability of water supply. \nAdditionally, we examined the exposure and vulnerability of \nour operations and communities to those hazards, looking \nat factors such as the density and occupancy of our sites, \namount of fresh water we withdraw, social vulnerability of \nlocal populations, and general ability of our operations to \nadapt to water shortage events. We used this assessment to \nbuild a water risk dashboard, which enables us to identify \npriority regions and sites for water stewardship projects.\n41\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

AWS finds ways to \nreturn used non-contact cooling water to the community, \nincluding conveying the water to third parties to use in \ngrowing crops such as alfalfa, soybeans, and wheat.\nDelivering Water Replenishment\nBy the end of 2023, AWS had invested in 15 water \nreplenishment activities, returning water to the communities \nwhere it operates across 12 of our global infrastructure \nregions.25 These investments have expanded AWS \nreplenishment activities to three new countries, bringing the \ntotal to 10: Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Ireland, South \nAfrica, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the U.S. These activities \nhelp recharge groundwater, build wetlands, improve water \nquality, and reduce water loss in utility systems. In 2023, \nAWS’s water replenishment portfolio returned 3.5 billion \nliters to local communities.\nWatershed Restoration in Australia\nAWS is working with the Great Eastern Ranges (GER)—a \nnongovernmental organization whose aim is to protect, \nconnect, and regenerate wildlife habitats across eastern \nAustralia—to enhance the health and functioning of the \nmajor watershed serving Sydney. Catastrophic bushfires \nin late 2019 and early 2020 damaged large areas of \nthis watershed. This joint project is restoring the local \nenvironment in key locations to improve water yield and \nquality, boost biodiversity, and enhance the resilience of \nlocal communities against the effects of climate change. \nTogether, AWS and GER have supported initiatives that are \nreducing polluted stormwater runoff, increasing groundwater \nrecharge, enhancing local biodiversity, and supporting \nwildlife, including 15 endangered species in the affected \narea. Once complete, the project is expected to deliver \nan additional 32 million liters of water each year to the \nSydney watershed.\nTackling Water Leaks in Spain \nSpain is considered one of the most water-stressed \nindustrialized countries in the world. It has experienced long-\nterm drought since 2022, driven in part by water loss from \naging infrastructure. To help address this, AWS worked with \nFIDO Tech, a cloud-based water leak detection company that \nuses AWS technology, to identify and reduce leakages in the \nwater system in Spain’s Villanueva de Gállego community. \nThis municipality is located in the province of Zaragoza, \nAragon, between Barcelona and Madrid, where AWS data \ncenters are located.\nAcoustic sensors placed on water pipes and meters used \nFIDO’s machine learning algorithm—built on AWS—to \nidentify the location and size of leaks so the community \ncould prioritize fixing the largest ones first.\nIn total, the sensors identified 21 leaks and other types of \nwater loss. By repairing the largest, highest-priority leaks \nfirst, the project is reducing water loss by an estimated 33 \nmillion liters per year.\nSupplying Water to Farmers in India and Indonesia\nTo improve access to water across India and Indonesia, \nAWS works with Water.org and WaterAid on a variety of \nprojects, such as microfinance loans, rainwater harvesting, \ngroundwater recharge, and piped water supply projects. For \nexample, loans have helped communities finance water pipe \nconnections and toilet installations in homes. Altogether, \nAWS’s investments in Water.org and WaterAid initiatives have \nbenefited 290,000 people.\nIn 2023, AWS announced new projects with SEARCH, a \nnonprofit organization that enables marginalized groups \nin rural India to enhance their socioeconomic status. These \nprojects will help provide a consistent water supply to \nfarmers in villages surrounding Hyderabad, where AWS has \noperations, by rehabilitating existing water storage ponds \nand constructing new ones. Once complete, the ponds are \nexpected to deliver 86 million liters of water back to the \ncommunity each year and help increase agricultural output. \nThe ponds will also help recharge groundwater in an area \ndesignated as a semi-critical exploitation zone due to \noverpumping of its underlying aquifer. In 2023, SEARCH \nbegan a detailed community engagement process to ensure \nprojects are implemented to maximize benefits for villagers. \nUsing More Sustainable Sources\nRecycled water typically has limited uses, including irrigation \nand industrial use. AWS uses recycled water for cooling, \nwhich helps preserve drinking water for local communities. \nIn 2023, AWS increased the number of data centers using \nrecycled water for cooling from 20 to 24, including two data \ncenters in Virginia, one in California, and one in Singapore.\nAWS has additionally begun harvesting rainwater as a \nsustainable water source. Using rainwater minimizes \ndemands on community water resources and reduces \npotential surface water pollution from stormwater runoff. In \nBrazil, two of its data centers collect rainwater, reducing how \nmuch potable water AWS needs for cooling.\nReusing Cooling Water in Communities\nAWS data centers circulate water through their cooling \nsystems as many times as possible, but eventually it needs to \nbe replaced with new water. While spent water can no longer \nbe used for cooling, it may be used for other purposes, such \nas irrigation. AWS is using advanced cloud services, such as \nIoT technologies, to analyze real-time water use, identify \nIn collaboration with the Washington Water Trust, AWS supported a drought relief program that enhances stream flows to help ensure \nhealthy salmon runs in the Dungeness River in Washington state’s Olympic Peninsula.\n42\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\nWaste and Circularity\nPackaging\nCarbon-Free Energy\nCarbon\nWater",

We strive to reduce water \nuse in our operations, which include logistics sites such as \nfulfillment centers, as well as in our corporate offices and \ngrocery stores. \nAcross our global logistics network, our teams actively look \nfor ways to conserve and reuse water. In 2023, we gathered \nrobust data to analyze how much water our facilities use and \ncreated a baseline for our water footprint to track progress \ngoing forward. We leveraged our water risk dashboard to \nmonitor water hazards and water-related business risks to \nprioritize improvements. To inform the investments we make \nin water infrastructure, we also performed cost-benefit \nanalyses for an array of water conservation, reuse, and \nharvesting projects. \nOperations \nIn 2023, Amazon scaled water replenishment, harvesting, \nand reuse solutions across our operations in countries around \nthe world.\nIndia ranks at the top of our list of water-stressed regions, \nand our water stewardship efforts there reflect the urgent \nneed to take action. In 2023, Amazon teams recharged local \naquifers with harvested rainwater, installed low-flow fixtures \nand waterless urinals, and built in-house sewage treatment \nplants to reuse wastewater for flushing and gardening. \nIn addition, these teams diverted runoff water from the \nLooking Forward\nTo build on progress made in 2023, we will continue to \nanalyze our water footprint and water risk assessment \nin both our direct operations and supply chain, as \nwell as develop a comprehensive water management \nstrategy tailored to unique geographic and business unit \nneeds. AWS will focus on making ongoing progress toward its \nwater positive goal, investing in efforts to restore watersheds \nand increase access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for \npeople who need it most.

Our operations there additionally \nsaved an estimated 3,700 cubic meters of water by installing \naerators in faucets, shifting from conventional to sensor \nfaucets, reducing toilet flush tank capacity, and recirculating \nwater used in fire pump testing rather than draining it. In \nNorth America, we added faucet aerators in 90% of our \nfulfillment centers, sort centers, and grocery logistics sites.\nIn Japan, we added rainwater harvesting as a criterion for \nbuilt-to-standard fulfillment centers, which will become \nstandard for buildings opening after 2025. We expect \nto finish building the first fulfillment center with this \ninfrastructure in late 2024, with an official launch in July \n2025. By harvesting rainwater, we estimate that this site will \nreduce its water withdrawal by up to 40%.\nAlong with scaling water conservation, harvesting, and reuse \nsolutions, Amazon has seeded a global water metering and \nleak detection program, with pilots at logistics, grocery, \nand data center sites in the U.S. and Europe supported \nby Amazon-developed software. Using machine learning, \nthe program automatically sends a repair ticket to our \nengineering team when it detects abnormal water flows. \nOne pilot in the UK saved an estimated 700,000 cubic \nmeters of leaked water over two years (2022 and 2023) \nat 53 monitored sites. This work is providing valuable \ninformation about where failures occur within our water \npipelines. We aim to scale this project to additional sites \nin 2024.\nCorporate Offices\nOur corporate offices increased water recycling and the use \nof low-flow fixtures in 2023. This work is part of our efforts \nto set new standards for design as we strive to reduce indoor \nwater use by more than 30% globally versus a Leadership \nin Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) baseline. Our \noffices in India and China, for example, replaced existing \nwater flow fixtures in bathrooms and utilities areas with \nlow-flow fixtures, reducing water use by 16%, or more than \n15.6 million gallons, compared to a 2022 baseline.\nWater.org Water & Climate Fund\nIn 2022, Amazon announced a partnership with \nWater.org to help launch the Water.org Water & \nClimate Fund, which focuses on climate-resilient \nwater and sanitation solutions.

    "text": "Community Impact\nSupplier Diversity\nSustainable Products and Materials\nResponsible Supply Chain\nHuman Rights\nOur Approach\nOur strategy to deliver on these commitments is based on \nthe UNGPs and has five pillars:\n•\t Develop and maintain strong policies and \nstandards: Our policies and standards are the backbone \nof our human rights strategy, spanning a diverse array of \npeople-centric topics. \n•\t Embed human rights into our business operations \nand decision-making: We are committed to embedding \nhuman rights considerations into decision-making \nacross our business and into our policy and governance \nframework, including by raising awareness among our \nemployees on human rights issues through education \nand trainings.\n•\t Assess, prioritize, and address risk: We have robust \nprocesses that allow us to effectively identify, prioritize, \nand ultimately address human rights risks across our \nbusiness and supply chain.\n•\t Engage with stakeholders: We are committed to \ndriving best practices in human rights due diligence \nby expanding our stakeholder engagement. Through \ncollaboration with stakeholders including supply chain \nworkers, employees and contractors, customers, and \ncommunities, we are creating effective, sustainable \nsolutions that put people first.\nRespect for human rights is woven throughout our business \nactivities and relationships, and we work to engage with \npartners and suppliers that are also committed to respecting \nhuman and labor rights. Just as we are committed to \npromoting the rights of our employees, we are committed \nto working with our suppliers to embed respect for human \nrights in their operations and supply chains and to help \nus further our goal to support the fundamental dignity of \neveryone we work with.\nWe take pride in our long-standing dedication and \ncommitment to human rights. While we continue to make \nprogress, we know that this work is ongoing, and there \nis always more to be done. We are constantly learning \nand making improvements to our policies, programs, and \neducational resources to help ensure that our employees and \nworkers everywhere we operate are treated with respect, \nknow their rights, and can safely speak up if they encounter \nrisks at work.\nOur human rights strategy is informed by leading \ninternational standards and frameworks developed by \nthe United Nations (UN) and the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO). Amazon is committed to respecting and \nsupporting the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business \nand Human Rights (UNGPs) \n \n , the UN Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights  , the Core Conventions of the ILO  , and  \nthe ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights \nat Work  . \nOur Progress\nRespecting human rights is critical to Amazon’s broader \nsustainability efforts and an area that requires ongoing, \nactive work across each of our strategic pillars. In 2023, we \nmaintained our focus on existing programs and embarked \non new work and partnerships to continue delivering on \nour commitments.\nDeveloping and Maintaining \nStrong Policies and Standards\nAmazon’s human rights strategy is anchored in policies that \napply across our business. We regularly review our strategy, \nprinciples, and supporting policies to identify opportunities \nfor improvement. By engaging external stakeholders \nand monitoring evolving international and human rights \nstandards, regulations, and industry best practices, we \nare able to effectively and continuously improve our own \npolicies and standards to better support our employees \nand suppliers. \nOur Global Human Rights Principles   demonstrate our \ncommitment to respecting fundamental human rights and \nthe dignity of people connected to our business around the \nworld. Our Supply Chain Standards   detail our requirements \nof and expectations for suppliers. They apply to all suppliers \nof goods and services for Amazon and are grounded in \nprinciples of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and \nsupply chain accountability. We review and update these \nstandards at least every three years—working with external \nstakeholders to align our requirements with current best \npractices and regulatory standards—and we make them \npublicly available in 21 languages and dialects.\nEmbedding Human Rights into \nOur Business\nAs a global company, we recognize the responsibility \nand opportunity we have to raise awareness among our \nemployees on human rights issues. We have a central team \nthat works across the company to conduct human rights \ndue diligence and integrate human rights considerations \ninto business decisions, and we strive to embed our human \nrights principles in employees’ everyday work by offering \ntraining curricula.\nIn 2023, we launched an online training, available to all \nAmazon employees, intended to raise awareness on the \nimportance of the company’s commitment to human rights. \nWe also offer our employees training tailored to some of \nAmazon’s salient human rights risks. For example, in 2023, \nwe updated our Forced Labor Awareness training, which is \navailable to employees in seven languages and is customized \nfor regional risks. The training builds awareness of the signs \nof potential cases of forced labor in the workplace and \nhow to report concerns to appropriate authorities. Updates \nenhance learners’ experience and direct them to our most \ncurrent internal resources.\nAs another example, we introduced “The Five Principles \nof Responsible Purchasing”  in 2023 to strengthen our \nsourcing and procurement teams’ understanding of how \npurchasing practices can drive respect for human rights \nin our supply chain. This online training, developed by \nthe Better Buying Institute, explains how our daily business \noperations can help suppliers improve factory working \nconditions and environmental performance. \n•\t Improve access to effective grievance mechanisms \nand remediation: We offer multiple channels for our \nemployees to voice grievances and concerns. We work \nhard to raise employee awareness of these grievance \nmechanisms and engage with suppliers to do the same \nfor their workers. \n46\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

We have a centralized team of experts \nwho work across the company to conduct human rights \nand environmental due diligence. With support from this \nteam, Amazon businesses work toward integrating our \nhuman rights principles into their operations and business \nrelationships by conducting human rights risk assessments \nand remedying identified issues.\nIn our supply chains, we assess and respond to risk by \nleveraging internal and external data and guidance from \nstakeholders, including industry experts, civil society groups, \nand nongovernmental organizations. We also engage directly \nwith suppliers and their workers and conduct independent \naudits to verify compliance with our Supply Chain Standards. \nWe work with suppliers on appropriate remediation measures \nand offer partnerships and programs to help them address \nrisks and invest in worker well-being. Our supply chain \nefforts focus on six priority commitment areas: Safe and \nHealthy Workplaces, Gender Equity, Fair Wages, Responsible \nRecruitment and Freely Chosen Employment, Environmental \nProtection, and Access to Effective Grievance Mechanisms.\nLearn more about our supply chain due diligence work \nWe understand that as our supply chain evolves, expanding \ninto new geographies and areas of business, so too do the \nrisks we face. We’re committed to growing and adapting our \nwork to meet these challenges—and helping others do so \nas well.\nHuman Rights Assessments\nIdentifying and prioritizing the most salient risks connected \nto Amazon operations and business relationships is \ncentral to our human rights due diligence practices.26 As \nwe continuously improve and expand these practices, we \nuse human rights assessment methodologies to identify \nand mitigate human rights risks. These assessments help \nus understand the causes of systemic issues, enhance \nongoing engagement with critical stakeholders, implement \nthe correct risk-based mitigation measures, and refine \nstrategies for ongoing risk management across our \nsupply chain. Examples of human rights assessment \nmethodologies include:\n•\t Human rights saliency assessments, which focus risk \nmanagement action and remediation on the most severe \nrisks relevant to a company’s business activity.\n•\t Human rights impact assessments (HRIAs), which \nexamine a particular business segment or product, a \ncountry of operation or sourcing, a potentially affected \ngroup, or other human rights risk areas for a specific \nsubset of a business.\n•\t Human rights due diligence management assessments, \nwhich analyze a business’s internal capacity to assess \nand respond to human rights risks. \nIn 2020, we worked with Article One, a business and human \nrights consulting firm, to complete an enterprise-wide \nhuman rights saliency assessment. Through this assessment, \nwe identified nine salient human rights risks across our \noperations and business relationships. That same year, we \nalso initiated a business-level HRIA with Amazon Devices  . \nEach year, we expand on our commitment to conduct \nbusiness-specific human rights assessments, ensuring we \nare always raising the bar on how we evaluate and respond \nto risks across our operations and supply chain. These \nassessments allow us to identify salient risks, build capacity \nand business-level ownership aligned to those risks, and \nconduct targeted human rights and environmental due \ndiligence to monitor and manage compliance.\n•\t Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n•\t Safe and Healthy Working Conditions\n•\t Modern Slavery and Forced Labor\n•\t Fair Wages and Hours\n•\t Freedom of Association\n•\t Future of Work\n•\t Right to Privacy\n•\t Product Safety and Security\n•\t Social, Economic, and Environmental Justice\nLearn more about our salient human rights risks \non our website \nOur Salient Human Rights Risks\nIdentifying and Addressing Modern Slavery \nIndicators across Amazon \nAddressing modern slavery requires a holistic approach that \nincludes commitments, resources, and innovative solutions \nfrom governments, international organizations, the private \nsector, and civil society. At Amazon, we understand the \nimportant role we can play in eradicating this issue and are \ncommitted to expanding our work to understand and address \nany modern slavery risks that may arise in our business.\nWe place a specific focus on vulnerable workers, including \nforeign and domestic migrant workers; contract, agency, \nand temporary workers; refugees; asylum seekers; ethnic/\nreligious minorities and displaced persons; Indigenous \npeoples; and young or student workers. \nIn 2023, we launched a new initiative to identify and \nproactively address forced labor and modern slavery risk \nindicators across our business. The program brings together \nteams across our company to identify and eliminate any \ninstances of exploitation—with a focus on victim safety. \nWorking with both internal and external experts in human \ntrafficking, the cross-functional team is establishing clear \nprotocols, mandatory training, and policies on identifying \npotential victims of forced labor or modern slavery \nwithin our business operations, as well as detailing what \nemployees should do if they observe any indicators of \nhuman trafficking. These include guidance on ensuring victim \nsafety and providing immediate support and assistance to \nthem, as well as involving relevant authorities and support \norganizations. More broadly, we are working to help our \nbusinesses understand how to address the root causes of \nany exploitation they identify within our supply chain and \nbusiness practices.\nLearn more about our policies and principles to assess  \nand address the risks of modern slavery within our supply \nchain in our Responsible Supply Chain section   and in our  \nModern Slavery Statement \nIn 2022, following several other HRIAs, we published an \nHRIA report with Twitch \n .27 In 2023, we conducted a human \nrights saliency assessment for Amazon Private Brands to \nbetter understand priority human rights risks across our \nproducts and how to best address them. We also identified \nways to facilitate stakeholder relationships at a more \nlocalized level in the Private Brands supply chain.\nWhole Foods Market, with support from Amazon’s central \nhuman rights team, worked with third-party advisory firm \nHuman Level to conduct a human rights due diligence \nmanagement assessment in 2023.

We \nhave dedicated teams in key sourcing regions that engage \ndirectly with suppliers to communicate our standards, \nevaluate risks in our supply chain, and help suppliers build \ntheir capacities to provide working environments that \nare safe and respectful of human rights. We also work \nclosely with strategic partners across the globe to enhance \nour influence.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on our six priority \ncommitment areas: \n•\t Safe and healthy workplaces\n•\t Gender equity\n•\t Fair wages\n•\t Responsible recruitment and freely chosen employment\n•\t Environmental protection \n•\t Access to effective grievance mechanisms\nOur Supply Chain Standards   are the backbone of our \nefforts to enable a responsible supply chain.28 They apply \nto all suppliers of goods and services for Amazon, including \nservice providers, vendors, selling partners, contractors, and \nsubcontractors (collectively, “suppliers”). Products sold in \nAmazon stores, as well as products and services provided \nto us, must be manufactured, produced, or provided in \naccordance with these standards. \nAn important part of our efforts to improve conditions \nacross our supply chain is assessing human rights risks to \naddress both site-specific challenges and broader, systemic \nissues. We work with our suppliers—and other partners, as \ndescribed in this section and our Human Rights section \n —\nto proactively mitigate these risks. We encourage suppliers to \nestablish management systems to oversee their compliance \nwith applicable laws, compliance with our Supply Chain \nStandards, and progress on addressing their most salient \nhuman rights and environmental risks. We also continuously \nmonitor regulations in the countries where we operate and \nactively engage with our teams and suppliers to meet new \nregulatory requirements. \nSelling Partners and Our \nStandards\nSelling partners are third-party sellers and retail vendors \nthat sell or provide products and services in Amazon \nstores. Our Supply Chain Standards apply to all products \nand services offered in our stores. We encourage selling \npartners to perform due diligence to help ensure their \nproducts and services are produced and supplied in ways that \nrespect human rights and the environment and protect the \nfundamental dignity of workers. \nIf we have reason to suspect that products from our selling \npartners do not meet our standards, we may request \nevidence of due diligence to demonstrate that products were \nindeed manufactured in accordance with our Supply Chain \nStandards. We reserve the right to remove products that do \nnot meet our standards from our stores.\nSupply Chain Transparency \nSupply chain transparency is a valuable tool to address \nrisks in our supply chain and identify opportunities for \ncollaboration on systemic issues. That’s why we publish a \nsupplier list and interactive supply chain map   with details \non finished-product suppliers of Amazon-branded apparel, \nconsumer electronics, food and beverage, and home goods \nproducts. Our 2023 supplier list included nearly 2,230 \nfinished-product suppliers. We update our supply chain map \nannually to provide customers and external stakeholders \nmore current visibility into where we source. In 2024, we will \nbegin to expand our supplier list and supply chain map to \ninclude some apparel component suppliers. \nWe also contribute our supplier list to the Open Supply \nHub   to foster brand collaboration and action in the \nindustry. Open Supply Hub is an accessible, collaborative \nsupply chain mapping platform, used and populated by \nstakeholders across sectors and supply chains. In 2023, we \nutilized tools in Open Supply Hub’s map function to list \nfacilities that produce Amazon-branded products, allowing \nusers to clearly and easily view our supply chain and interact \nwith facility data. \nLearn more about our ongoing engagement with critical \nstakeholders to advance human rights in our supply chain  \nSupplier Assessments\nWe assess suppliers of Amazon-branded products globally \nduring onboarding, and periodically thereafter, to evaluate \ntheir compliance with our Supply Chain Standards in four \ncategories: Labor Rights, Ethics, Environment, and Health \nand Safety. These categories include subcategories such \nas nondiscrimination, emergency preparedness, hazardous \nsubstances, and transparency. By assessing the performance \nof our suppliers, we improve working conditions and \nstrengthen the resilience of our supply chain.\nWe accept audits completed by qualified independent \naudit firms based on our own standards and those of \nindustry associations, including the Sedex Members Ethical \nTrade Audit (SMETA), amfori Business Social Compliance \nInitiative (amfori BSCI), Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), \nSocial Accountability International (SA8000 standard and \ncertification system), and Better Work. \nWhen we identify a gap between a supplier’s practices \nand our Supply Chain Standards, we track remediation \nand conduct follow-up assessments as needed. Between \nassessments, our central team directly engages with the \nsupplier to discuss open issues and remediation progress and \nprovides them with issue-specific remediation guidebooks. \nFailure to implement the actions listed in the corrective \naction plan may prevent the supplier from continuing \nproduction or providing services or labor to us. \nLearn more about our auditing and remediation \nprocesses \n51\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

As necessary, suppliers must also \nundergo follow-up assessments to confirm the sufficient \nremediation of identified issues. \nSupplier Assessments\nOur approach to enabling a more responsible supply chain is \nrooted in our commitment to workers and based on a model \nof continuous improvement. We offer on-site and remote \ntraining to support supplier remediation, and we expect \nsuppliers to act within an agreed-upon timeline, remove \nharm, act in the best interests of workers, and commit to \npreventing similar issues in the future. We know that change \ndoes not happen overnight and are committed to supporting \nour suppliers in remediating issues over time.\nAssessment findings are flagged as high, medium, or low \ndepending on severity. When high- and medium-level issues \nare identified, we take steps to verify that suppliers have \nmade meaningful progress toward remediation. \nA high-level finding is an issue that has caused or is likely \nto cause immediate harm to workers or communities or \ndemonstrates egregious unethical behavior. A medium-\nlevel finding is an issue that poses significant risk of \nharm to workers or communities or demonstrates \nunethical or exploitative behavior. For low-level issues, we \nmonitor suppliers for continuous improvement through \nmaintenance audits. \nOur Progress\nEnabling safe, equitable, fair, and sustainable supply chains \nthrough our six priority commitment areas goes well beyond \nsetting supplier standards.

By the end of 2023, nearly 1,750 workers, \nincluding over 1,180 female workers, had completed the \ntraining in China and India. In China, 90% of participants \nreported that they were aware of their workplace’s sexual \nharassment prevention policies, compared to 48% before we \nlaunched the program.\nLearn more about our approach to promoting equity across \nour value chain   and enhancing supplier diversity \nFair Wages\nWe believe everyone has a right to be paid fairly for the work \nthey perform, and ensuring workers receive fair pay remains \na global, cross-industry issue. That’s why fair wages is one of \nour six priority commitment areas. \nWe monitor wage payments throughout our supply chains \nto inform more meaningful supplier engagements, enhance \nour human rights due diligence processes, and promote \ncontinuous improvement in the fair and on-time payment of \nwages. In accordance with our Supply Chain Standards, our \nsuppliers must pay legally required compensation, including \novertime and benefits, and we support them in evaluating \nwhether their workers earn enough to meet their basic \nneeds and those of their families. In 2023, we began working \nwith select suppliers to benchmark worker compensation \nagainst regionally specific fair wages, focusing on electronics \nmanufacturing and packaging—two areas where there is a \nlack of industry-wide data on worker wages. In 2024, we will \nexpand these efforts to apparel manufacturing. \nProgress on wages and working hours requires us to \ncontinuously evaluate and strengthen our own processes, \nincluding our purchasing practices. Based on anonymous \nsupplier feedback collected through the Better Buying \nInstitute  , we implemented new programs to improve our \nforecasting, communication, and payments systems, and \nmoving forward, we will use the Better Buying survey to \nmeasure whether these programs had a positive impact.  \nResponsible Recruitment and Freely Chosen \nEmployment\nAs outlined in our Global Human Rights Principles  , we do \nnot tolerate child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking \nin any form in our operations or supply chain. We advance \nholistic approaches to combat forced labor and ensure \nvulnerable workers, especially foreign migrants, have access \nto transparent information on working conditions including \npay, hiring practices, and contract terms.\naccidents, injuries, and unsafe conditions. We work with \nsuppliers globally to support worker health and safety \nthrough targeted programs and partnerships that increase \nworker awareness of safety issues, support their well-being, \nand promote a culture of shared safety responsibility. \nWe also partner with global organizations that are dedicated \nto maintaining safe and healthy workplaces in the countries \nwhere we operate. In February 2024, we joined Nirapon \n(safe place in Bangla), an industry-led nonprofit that works \nwith global brands, retailers, manufacturers, and other \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to create and sustain \na culture of workplace safety in factories in Bangladesh.\nBuilding, Electrical, and Fire Safety \nBuilding, electrical, and fire safety is a critical part of our \ncommitment to maintain safe and healthy workplaces. In \n2023, we began the process to join Life and Building Safety \n(LABS) Initiative, officially becoming members in April 2024. \nLABS is an industry-driven program working to mitigate \npreventable fire, electrical, and structural building safety \nrisks in key apparel- and footwear-producing countries.\nThrough our Building, Electrical, and Fire Safety (BEFS) \nprogram, we also conduct issue-specific assessments that \nidentify and remediate structural, electrical, and fire safety \nissues, going beyond traditional social compliance audits in \ncountries that are not covered by Nirapon or LABS. In 2023, \nwe completed BEFS assessments for Tier 1 supplier sites in \nCambodia and Pakistan. \nMeasuring Good Health \nExamining the outcomes of our health and safety programs \nand partnerships helps build evidence for continued \ninvestment in worker health that can support ongoing \nand future efforts throughout our supply chain. In 2023, \nan assessment we conducted found that every dollar we \ninvested in supplier health projects during COVID-19 in \nBangladesh and Vietnam generated approximately $3.02 of \nsocioeconomic value, including reduced health expenditures \nfor our factory workforce and their families, health care \nworkers, suppliers, and implementing partners (e.g., PATH \nSupplier Training and Awareness \nThroughout our relationship with our suppliers, we provide \nresources and training to help them strengthen their ability \nto respect human rights and the environment within their \nown workplace and supply chain. \nIn 2023, we hosted in-person and online training events \non our Supply Chain Standards. These trainings reached \n458 suppliers in 14 countries/regions. \nWe also launched a new in-person peer-learning workshop \nseries that convenes factory management to hear from \nindustry experts and share best practices for addressing \ncommon challenges. This workshop series reached 105 \nsuppliers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mainland China, Malaysia, \nSaudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United \nArab Emirates. \nWe also continued our work with the Indirect Spend \nAlliance (ISA), an industry working group that aims to \nidentify operational areas of shared human rights risks \nin procurement and to design a single industry approach \nto address hotspots. In 2023, in partnership with ISA, \nwe created a risk matrix outlining human rights risks for \nour indirect spend areas including construction, waste \nmanagement, and shipping. Companies we contract with to \nprovide goods and services directly to Amazon can use this \nmatrix to better understand key human rights risks. \nProgress across Our Six Priority \nCommitment Areas \nIn 2023, we continued making progress across each of our six \npriority commitment areas through continuous commitment \nand action. \nSafe and Healthy Workplaces\nEveryone has the right to a safe and healthy workplace with \nappropriate rules and practices for reporting and preventing \n54\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

The violations ranged \nfrom recruitment fees paid by migrant workers to \nthe absence of grievance mechanisms and issues with \nworker accommodations. External organizations raised \nsimilar concerns and shared information with us about \nthese and other human rights risks collected during \ninterviews with former employees of this third-party \nvendor. \nIn response, we conducted a deeper dive into practices \nof our third-party vendors throughout Saudi Arabia \nand developed a series of short- and long-term \nmeasures to remedy immediate issues and prevent \nfuture recurrence. We brought in two independent \nthird parties to assist with our investigation and \nengaged directly with contracted workers through \ninterviews to help establish reimbursement amounts \nand manage repayment. As of February 2024, we had \nreimbursed more than 700 contracted workers across \nall our third-party vendors in Saudi Arabia, totaling \nmore than $1.9 million in reimbursed recruitment fees \nand related costs. Through audits, we also verified \nthat the third-party vendor remediated concerns \nabout worker housing. Additionally, we secured the \nvendor’s commitment that even after its employees \nno longer work at Amazon, it will pay them in line \nwith their contracts and won’t move them to a new \naccommodation site that fails to meet Amazon’s \nstandards. The vendor also established a more robust \nsystem to enable workers to anonymously raise \ngrievances moving forward. \nWe also adopted enhanced controls to reduce the \nrisk of recurrence, including strengthening contracts \nto clarify expectations regarding compliance with \nour Supply Chain Standards; reviewing wage policies, \nincluding clarification that illegal wage deductions are \nprohibited; providing additional training to vendors \nin the region on how to implement our Supply Chain \nStandards, including responsible recruitment practices; \nand improving our communication mechanism that \nenables contracted workers to share concerns directly \nwith Amazon management.

Through this strategic collaboration, we \nwill work together to advance our suppliers’ and business \npartners’ respect of migrant workers’ rights and improve \nsafe labor migration and socioeconomic inclusion. Amazon \nand IOM will focus on human rights due diligence, mapping \nlabor migration processes across relevant corridors, capacity \nbuilding of supply chain partners in countries of origin and \ndestination, and engaging in multi-stakeholder initiatives to \ndrive positive change across relevant industries.\nWe encourage suppliers to participate in external training \nprograms, such as industry association tutorials, to enable \nthem to better recognize and prevent modern slavery and \nimplement high-quality management systems. We also \nprovide suppliers with responsible recruitment training. In \n2023, we extended our responsible recruitment training to \nour logistics and services providers and expanded offerings \nin additional countries that are common destinations for \nforeign migrant workers.

The caller \nwanted the behavior to stop but did not want to \nanger the supervisor or be singled out. To ensure \ntimely and effective remediation, Amader Kotha \nquickly contacted our supplier’s management \nwithout disclosing any personal information that \ncould identify the complainant. In response, the \nsupplier’s management counseled the supervisor \non appropriate behavior, after which the worker \nnoticed a marked improvement in the supervisor’s \nlanguage. We are proud to support Amader \nKotha’s efforts to bring about timely remediation \nto worker concerns and improve working \nconditions in manufacturing facilities.\nReport to Resolution: The Amader Kotha \nProcess in Action \nLooking Forward\nBuilding responsible supply chains is an ongoing endeavor—\none that requires collective effort and continuous \nimprovement from Amazon, our suppliers, and our network \nof expert partners. We are investing in identifying and \naddressing the most severe human rights and environmental \nrisks throughout our supply chain. We will continue engaging \ninternal and external stakeholders in our efforts to make \nprogress across our six priority commitment areas and, in \ndoing so, enable working conditions that respect supply chain \nworkers and the environments where we operate.\nto serve workers and communities in industries spanning \ngarment, agriculture, mining, and more. Using these \nchannels, suppliers can gather feedback directly from \nworkers to inform more effective issue resolution. In 2023, \nthrough the Amader Kotha Helpline, workers in Bangladesh \nreported nearly 760 grievances, of which over 560 related \nto workplace concerns. The top five workplace concerns for \nAmazon suppliers were wages, leave, verbal abuse, factory \nwelfare facilities, and termination, while the remaining \ninquiries included more general topics such as domestic \nissues or the government’s policy on worker benefits. Ulula, \nmeanwhile, is available to workers in Cambodia, China, India, \nand Pakistan. During 2023, workers with access to Ulula \nmost frequently reported issues related to health and safety \nand wages. \nIn 2023, we expanded our grievance mechanisms program \nto include additional supplier segments across our supply \nchain. In Japan, we partnered with the Japan Platform \nfor Migrant Workers Towards Responsible and Inclusive \nSociety (JP-MIRAI) so that certain suppliers in Japan could \nprovide their workers access to JP-MIRAI’s independent \ngrievance mechanism. \nIn the Middle East, North Africa, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S., \nwe conducted focus groups with contract workers within \nour global operations to understand their familiarity with \ngrievance mechanisms, whether they are able to access them, \nand what barriers they face in using them. \nFor all individuals, including members of the public, \nemployees, and workers in our supply chain, we introduced \na new way to notify us about potential human rights and \nenvironmental concerns—a web form   where people \ncan anonymously report cases directly to Amazon. The \nform is available in 19 languages and dialects and can be \naccessed globally. \nModule (FEM), a self-assessment owned and developed by \nCascale, exclusively licensed to the Worldly   sustainability \ndata and insights platform.

To do this, we connect suppliers and \nservice providers with trusted tools, products, and systems \nto hear directly from workers about their experiences and \nsupport the resolution of issues from workers’ perspectives. \nWe believe this is fundamental to supporting the safety and \nwell-being of the workers in our supply chain.\nIn 2023, we helped connect supplier sites across Bangladesh, \nCambodia, China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand \nwith independent grievance mechanisms. Of the nearly 800 \nworker grievances raised using these mechanisms, 100% \nwere investigated and resolved.  \nThe Amader Kotha Helpline and Ulula are two examples \nof effective grievance mechanisms that we introduced \nto our suppliers. The Amader Kotha Helpline is an \nindependent helpline serving the ready-made garment \nsector in Bangladesh, while Ulula uses a range of grievance \nmechanisms—including helplines to messaging platforms—\n57\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

Through our \ncommodities sourcing goals, we prioritize using recycled \ncontent, reducing material use, and improving recyclability \nof our products. We also consider the use phase of our \nproducts and have programs in place to help customers keep \ntheir products in use for longer. In 2023, we expanded these \nefforts by launching a spare parts and repair program in \nEurope for our private brands products. \nAmazon non-grocery private brands offers everything from \nbeauty and skin care to diapers and infant wipes. In 2023,  \nwe published a Formulated Products Restricted Substances \nList   for cleaning, beauty, and personal care. We also \nexpanded our compliance with AFIRM’s Restricted \nSubstances List   to home textile products, which we \nactively enforce with our suppliers. \nResponsible Mineral Sourcing\nWhile Amazon does not engage in direct sourcing from \nmine sites and smelters, we are committed to avoiding the \nuse of minerals that have fueled conflict. We strive to have \n100% of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (3TG) smelters \nand refiners in our supply chain conform with a recognized \nminerals certification program. These certifications, such \nas the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)’s Responsible \nMinerals Assurance Process (RMAP), are critical to enabling \nresponsible raw material sourcing and processing upstream \nin the supply chain. We support suppliers in their efforts \nto increase smelter audits through RMAP, and we expect \nour suppliers to remove nonconformant smelters from our \nsupply chain.\nCobalt is a raw mineral used in batteries, including those \nfor electric vehicles. In 2023, we built on our existing 3TG \ndue diligence processes and conducted cobalt due diligence \nwith additional suppliers using industry-standard reporting \ntemplates. This improves our efforts to understand and \nmitigate risks in the cobalt supply chain while also signaling \nto suppliers the importance of responsible mineral sourcing \nbeyond 3TG.\nAmazon Devices\nWe believe products can and should be more sustainable \nwhile maintaining high quality and affordability. In 2023, we \nlaunched 28 new Echo, Fire TV, Fire tablet, Kindle e-reader, \nRing, Blink, and smart home devices and accessories that \nwere recognized by certifications in our Climate Pledge \nFriendly program.\nWe design our devices with a focus on carbon reduction \nand manufacture them with responsibly sourced materials. \nSustainability is considered throughout the lifecycle of a \nproduct—from how we build it to how our customers use \nand retire it. We want every new Amazon device to be \nmore energy-efficient and less resource-intensive than the \nprevious generation. \nLearn more about how we are making our devices more \ncarbon- and resource-efficient \n , investing in carbon-free \nenergy \n , and giving devices a second chance \nClimate Pledge Friendly\nCertifications\nOur Climate Pledge Friendly program helps customers \ndiscover more sustainable products that are recognized to \nhave at least one sustainable feature. In 2023, our customers \ncontinued to embrace this program, purchasing 1.16 billion \nitems recognized by certifications in the Climate Pledge \nFriendly program—a 42% increase from 2022.\nIn order to provide this breadth of options for our customers, \nwe encourage our selling partners to develop and offer \nproducts that meet the criteria for one or more of the 55 \ncertifications in our Climate Pledge Friendly program. These \ncertifications recognize products that address at least one \naspect of sustainability, ranging from recycled content to \nenergy efficiency to safer chemicals. \nWe routinely assess the certification landscape, adding \nand developing new certifications for the program and \nWe incorporate recycled materials into our devices whenever \npossible. As of the end of 2023, among Echo, Fire TV, Fire \ntablet, Kindle, and smart home products, we had various \nproducts made from majority- or all-recycled content, \nincluding those containing: \n•\t 75% recycled plastic \n•\t 100% recycled yarn\n•\t 100% recycled aluminum \n•\t 90% recycled magnesium\nIn addition to using recycled materials in our devices, we \nextend this practice to device packaging.\nLearn more about our device packaging   and  \ndevice recycling \nWe engage suppliers on the importance of responsible \nmineral sourcing mechanisms and industry collaboration. \nWe also maintain membership in RMI, the Copper Mark, \nand the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals \nTrade. Through these, we collaborate with industry peers, \ngovernments, and civil society actors on increasing supply \nchain transparency and improving sourcing across mineral \nvalue chains.\nIn 2023, we partnered with the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID), BHP Foundation  , and the Chandler \nFoundation for the Powering a Just Energy Transition Green \nMinerals Challenge (JET Minerals Challenge). Amazon \nmentored finalists and participated in a pitch workshop \nto catalyze the development, application, and scaling \nof innovations to strengthen transparency and counter \ncorruption in critical mineral supply chains. The JET Minerals \nChallenge closed with 11 winners from 15 countries and \ntargeted more than 10 mineral supply chains critical to the \nenergy transition. \nreviewing our existing ones against our high bar for \ntransparency, credibility, and customer trust. International \nSustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC+) to help \ncustomers easily identify products that are made with \nrecycled content and bio-based materials. We also added \nthe U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol, a product-traceable cotton \nstandard that drives continuous improvement across water \nuse, energy efficiency, carbon emissions, soil conservation, \nsoil carbon, and land use. When selling partners offer a \nproduct with a sustainability feature not captured by an \nexisting certification in the program, we consider supporting \nopportunities to fill the gap. For example, in 2023, Amazon \ninitiated the development of the Recycled Content Standard \nfor Electronics and Electrical Equipment in partnership with \nstandards development organization SCS Standards. This \ninvolved a multi-stakeholder process with representatives \nfrom industry and NGOs including the Center for the Circular \nEconomy at Closed Loop Partners, the Ellen MacArthur \nFoundation, De’Longhi, Dell Technologies, HP, Microsoft, \nLogitech, Philips, and The Recycling Partnership.\nWe expanded our collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur \nFoundation to drive scalable, industry-wide solutions for a \ncircular economy in 2023. As a Strategic Partner of the Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation Network, we are working to leverage \nour reach, technology, and innovation capabilities and the \nfoundation’s subject-matter expertise to launch and scale \ncircular economy solutions. Through this partnership, we are \nworking to develop certifications for products with circular \nfeatures, providing customers with the information they \nneed to make a more circular choice. These certifications \nencourage brands, original equipment manufacturers, \nsuppliers, retailers, and e-commerce platforms to create \nproducts that are designed in accordance with circular \neconomy principles.\nWe collaborate with our selling partners to identify \nopportunities for them to develop more sustainable products \nand apply for certifications that recognize the strides they \nare already making in sustainability. In 2023, we worked \nwith a variety of selling partners—such as L’Oréal, Levi’s, \n62\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

In 2023, we enhanced our Tier 2 reporting \nsystem to enable our suppliers to report their diverse \nsupplier spend on a quarterly and, for some, monthly basis.\nExpanding SDI Globally\nAs a global company, we are able to drive economic \nempowerment for more businesses around the world. While \nAmazon's SDI initiative began in the U.S., we are focused on \nexpanding these efforts internationally, integrating more \ncertified diverse suppliers into our global supply chain. We \nare committed to an inclusive global supply chain and insist \non the highest bar of equivalent certification standards and \nprocesses, as utilized in the U.S.\nIn 2023, Amazon expanded our SDI strategy outside the U.S. \nfor the first time, launching in seven new countries: Australia, \nBrazil, Canada, Costa Rica, India, South Africa, and the UK. \nThis work represents a meaningful step in our journey to \nCertified Tier 2 Diverse Suppliers\nWe encourage our Tier 1 suppliers to also consider \npurchasing goods and services from certified diverse \ncompanies. This creates a ripple effect of investment \ndeeper in our supply chain.\n$\n$\nCertified Tier 1 Diverse Suppliers\nOur SDI program is dedicated to the inclusion of \nbusinesses owned by an individual or group that is a \nmember of a traditionally underrepresented or \nunderutilized group. Spending with certified Tier 1 \ndiverse suppliers spurs economic growth and \nsupports jobs in our suppliers’ communities.\nWe purchase goods and services directly from small, \nmedium, and large global companies to support our \nbusiness entities.

We \nleverage our people, technology, and logistics networks \nto build programs and products that help enable future \ngenerations to thrive in our communities. We focus on \nseveral priority areas across our business and respond \nto emergent needs where we are uniquely positioned to \nmake a positive difference. Our work especially emphasizes \nhistorically underrepresented communities, because we \nenvision a world that embraces diverse perspectives and \nwhere all individuals have equitable opportunities. \nAmazon’s community impact efforts are focused on seven \nkey areas:\n•\t Supporting economic impact in communities: Amazon \nadds economic vibrancy to the communities where we \noperate through investments and job creation. Our \ninvestments in economies across the globe expand \nopportunities for local residents and small businesses \nand catalyze local economic activity.\n•\t Creating and preserving affordable housing: All people \nshould have access to housing they can afford, but many \ncommunities in the U.S. are facing an affordable housing \nshortage, with low-income and minority families \ndisproportionately affected. That is why we created the \nAmazon Housing Equity Fund, a $2 billion commitment \nto use our scale and reach to support innovative housing \nsolutions in the communities we call home. \n•\t Addressing food insecurity and basic needs: Amazon \naims to improve access to healthy, affordable food for \ncustomers in underserved communities across the U.S. \nEach year, we donate groceries to local food banks and \nleverage our logistics network to provide free delivery \nof groceries to families in need. Additionally, the Whole \nFoods Market Foundation seeks to enhance livelihoods \nin its sourcing communities, bring more nutritious \nfoods into children’s schools and homes, and improve \nlocal food systems and healthy food access. It is also \ninvesting in producer loan and accelerator programs that \nempower small-scale, local, and emerging producers to \ngrow their businesses.\n•\t Empowering students and adults through education \nand skills training: We believe in the transformative \npower of education, which is why we invest in programs \nthat help young learners, higher education students, \nand adults unlock their full potential. Our goal is to \nhelp 29 million people globally grow their technical skills \nwith free cloud computing training by 2025 through \nAWS-designed programs. Additionally, with the rapid \ngrowth of artificial intelligence (AI) and the need for an \nAI-savvy workforce, Amazon has pledged to provide free \nAI skills training to 2 million people globally by 2025. \n•\t Supporting disaster relief and response efforts: \nOur global logistics capabilities, combined with AWS \ntechnology, make us uniquely suited to help people \nwhen natural disasters strike. Our disaster relief \nand response efforts provide fast, effective aid for \naffected communities.\n•\t Funding nature in our communities: We support \nthe restoration and conservation of natural spaces \nin communities across the globe. Through Amazon’s \nRight Now Climate Fund, we invest in projects that \naim to mitigate the effects of climate change, add \ngreen space to urban areas, improve biodiversity, and \nenhance livelihoods.\n•\t Addressing health equity: We are focused on providing \nequitable access to health resources. In 2021, AWS \nlaunched the AWS Health Equity Initiative, a three-year \nprogram with the goal of enhancing health outcomes for \nunderserved and historically marginalized communities. \nWe aim to distribute up to $60 million in cloud \ncomputing credits to support organizations promoting \nhealth equity globally by the end of 2024.\nLearn more about our community investments in the  \nU.S.   and how we are supporting communities globally \nThrough support from the Right Now Climate Fund, CIFAL Málaga-UNITAR and Amazon launched the Green Helmets educational initiative, \ndesigned to teach young people in Spain how to develop and implement sustainability projects.\n68\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

Amazon has made significant investments in \nthe U.S. economy   since 2010, which have contributed \nmore than $880 billion to national gross domestic product \n(GDP)  . We have supported 4.5 million American jobs   \nthrough full- and part-time jobs created directly by Amazon, \njobs indirectly supported by our investments in areas like \nconstruction and logistics, and jobs created by small and \nmedium-sized businesses selling on Amazon.com.

Since 2016, Amazon has \ndistributed over $100 million in cash and in-\nkind donations to Mary’s Place to address family \nhomelessness in King County. In 2020, Amazon \nand Mary’s Place united to open the Mary’s Place \nFamily Center in The Regrade—a first-of-its-kind \npermanent family shelter that operates inside an \nAmazon building on our Seattle campus.\nIn 2023, Amazon donated over $6 million to \nMary’s Place to support its ongoing operations \nand provide funding toward a new project in \nBurien, Washington.

Launched in June 2023, the Skills \nto Jobs Tech Alliance supported 725 educational institutions \nthat collectively serve more than 73,000 students in the U.S., \nEgypt, and Spain, with plans to expand to more countries.\nOther opportunities AWS provides include: \n•\t AWS Educate, an on-demand learning platform that \noffers hundreds of hours of free, self-paced training and \nresources for new-to-cloud learners—including hands-\non labs, generative AI courses, and an exclusive job \nboard. The program is available to learners as young as \n13 in over 200 countries and territories.\n•\t AWS Academy, which provides higher education \ninstitutions with a free, ready-to-teach cloud computing \ncurriculum that prepares students to pursue industry-\nrecognized certifications and in-demand cloud jobs. In \n2023, over 6,800 institutions used the curriculum.\n•\t AWS AI ML Scholarships, a scholarship program \nproviding underserved or underrepresented high \nschool and higher education students globally with \nopportunities to learn the AI and machine learning \n(ML) skills needed to prepare for careers in technology. \nAWS awarded a total of 2,500 AWS AI ML Scholarships \nin 2023.\nAWS InCommunities \nAWS InCommunities is a community outreach \nprogram that aims to positively influence the \ncommunities where AWS builds and operates its \nglobal infrastructure. Four pillars anchor this work: \nScience, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math \n(STEAM) Education; Local Skills Development; \nSustainability; and Hyperlocal Social Impact.\nThrough its programming, in 2023, AWS \nInCommunities drove nearly 6 million positive \ncommunity interactions—defined as an \nengagement with a community member that \nresults in a benefit for the recipient. One of its \nmost notable initiatives is the AWS InCommunities \nFund, a microgrant program that supports local \nindividuals and organizations driving positive \nchange. AWS launched 10 of these microgrants in \n2023, helping renovate schools and rural hospitals \nin India, establish community health care facilities \nin Indonesia, implement food access programs in \nAustralia, support sustainability programs such as \ntextile recycling in the U.S., and more.\nSince its launch in 2021, AWS InCommunities \nhas allocated over $2.1 million in microgrants to \nbolster hyperlocal projects in communities around \nthe world. In 2023 alone, more than 5,800 AWS \nemployees volunteered nearly 22,000 hours to \nsupport AWS InCommunities programs across its \nfour areas of focus.\n71\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

As part of this initiative, we launched eight new, \nfree AI and generative AI courses; an AWS Generative AI \nScholarship that provides high school and university students \nwith access to a new generative AI course on Udacity; and a \nnew collaboration with Code.org designed to help students \nlearn about generative AI. \nSupporting Disaster Relief and \nResponse Efforts\nWe mobilize the full breadth of our infrastructure, cloud \ntechnology, and global logistics network to help communities \naffected by natural disasters. Disaster Relief by Amazon \ndelivers speed in the form of logistics and inventory, while \nAWS Disaster Response delivers information through access \nto connectivity and data.\nGlobal disaster relief hubs within our fulfillment centers in \nthe U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia form the backbone \nof our strategy. These hubs store ready-to-ship essential \nitems that are most needed following natural disasters \nand other emergencies, including shelter and shelter-repair \nmaterials, hygiene supplies, medical equipment, and basic \nhousehold items. \nIn 2023, Amazon donated more than 2 million items in \nresponse to 44 disaster-related events around the globe. \nThese included the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and \nSyria, where we donated tents, sleeping bags, blankets, \nheaters, and other much-needed supplies. A group of \nAmazon employees from our Istanbul fulfillment center \nalso traveled to the affected region to help manage a relief \nwarehouse and support the logistics and delivery of items. \nIn November 2023, our efforts continued as Amazon \nand local charity partners announced the opening of the \n“Smiling Dreams Community House” in an area of Turkey \nthat sustained heavy damage from the earthquakes. \nThe Community House acts as a support center for local \nresidents affected by the disaster, providing therapy and \npsychotherapy sessions for people of all ages, as well as \nSTEM education for children.\nAmazon brings AWS cloud technology to areas hard-hit by \nnatural disasters to support mapping, establish connectivity, \nand quickly increase capacity for emergency call centers. \nIn 2023, AWS responded to 14 disasters and provided 103 \naffected business customers with $3.5 million worth of \ncloud credit donations to facilitate emergency services. \nAWS also provided its technology to assist responders in \nHawaii, helping coordinate support and make it possible for \ncommunity members to contact loved ones following the \nhistoric wildfires in Maui.\nAmazon committed more than $105 million through 2023 \nto help the people of Ukraine address both immediate and \nlong-term needs. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine \nin 2022, we have continued to deliver timely and appropriate \nrelief. \nGiving Back through Volunteering Efforts \nAmazon encourages and enables our global teams to \nvolunteer in their communities and support the causes they \nare passionate about. In 2023, over 170,000 volunteers from \n54 countries participated in more than 25,000 events with \nmore than 5,700 nonprofit and community organizations. \nThis included over 76,000 Amazon volunteers who joined \nour second Global Month of Volunteering. During this \ninitiative, team members volunteered for more than 4,500 \nevents supporting over 1,200 nonprofit and community \norganizations—cleaning up parks, donating school supplies \nand clothing to students, building houses for families \nexperiencing homelessness, assembling wish boxes for kids, \nand delivering meals to local food banks.\n•\t AWS Skills Centers, in-person learning that offers \nno-cost, on-site and virtual cloud computing classes, \nphysical learning spaces, and networking events.

Our goal is to keep using our infrastructure, \ntechnology, and passion for invention—along with the \nuniquely-Amazon skills and know-how of our global \nworkforce—to unlock new opportunities for our communities \nacross the globe.\nFunding Nature in Our Communities \nWe use nature-based solutions   to mitigate carbon emissions outside of our value \nchain and supplement the carbon reduction efforts we’re driving across our operations. \nOne critical aspect of this work is our commitment to investing in initiatives that protect \nthe natural world, improve wildlife habitats, and promote biodiversity.\nTo bring this to life, we established the Right Now Climate Fund in 2019 with the aim of \nsupporting solutions to restore and conserve natural spaces globally. The fund finances \ncommunity-focused projects that mitigate the effects of climate change, improve \nbiodiversity, enhance livelihoods, and add green space to urban areas. In 2023, we \ncontinued to fund nature projects in communities around the world. \nIreland: Amazon donated €2.5 million to The Nature \nTrust to help rehabilitate up to 500 hectares of degraded \nAtlantic blanket bog and restore it to a functioning \npeatland habitat. \nSpain: In partnership with CIFAL Málaga-UNITAR (the United \nNations Institute for Training and Research), we launched the \nGreen Helmets education initiative, designed to teach young \npeople how to develop and implement nature conservation \nprojects. Nearly 3,650 students from 60 schools in Andalusia \ncompleted the training and submitted project ideas that \ncontribute to the recovery and protection of nature. Ten \nprojects were selected to be developed in 2024, with each \nreceiving €10,000 from the Right Now Climate Fund. The \ninitiative also planted 20,000 trees and distributed more \nthan 26,000 seed bombs, with drones distributing more than \n400,000 seeds to 500 hectares of difficult-to-access areas in the \nSierra Bermeja region that was recently devastated by wildfires.\nThe Netherlands: Amazon granted €1.5 million to a \nconsortium of partners headed by North Sea Farmers to \ndevelop the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm \nlocated between offshore wind turbines. The project will \ntest methods of seaweed farming while researching the \npotential of seaweed to sequester carbon.\nAsia-Pacific: We announced   $15 million for nature-based \nprojects in the region, with the first $3 million allocated to \nIndia. Amazon will allocate the remainder of this funding to \nother key biodiversity and climate adaptation hotspots in \nthe region. \nIndia: Amazon has committed 83 million INR ($1 million) to \nthe Centre for Wildlife Studies to support communities and \nconservation efforts in the Western Ghats. This UNESCO \nWorld Heritage Site and critical wildlife conservation zone is \nhome to wild Asian elephants and tigers. Amazon’s funding \nwill expand the Wild Carbon project, which will enable \n2,000 farmers and their households to plant up to 300,000 \ntrees over three years.\nUnited Kingdom: We funded the planting of approximately \n450,000 trees across the country through the Woodland \nTrust’s Emergency Tree Fund. We also contributed funding \nfor 22 nature restoration projects through the Mayor of \nLondon’s Rewild London Fund, in partnership with London \nWildlife Trust and Groundwork London. These projects are \nprotecting water voles, improving habitats for reptiles, and \nreintroducing beavers to West London for the first time in \n400 years. Watch them take their first dip in the wild  . \nUnited States: Volunteers from Amazon helped restore \nOlympia oyster populations in the Puget Sound region of \nWashington. In 2022 and 2023, we committed $310,000 \nto the Puget Sound Restoration Fund to help plant more \nthan 3 million oyster seeds. In California, Amazon donated \n$100,000 to The Bay Foundation to restore approximately \n2.5 acres of giant kelp forests off the state’s southern coast. \nLearn more about our large-scale, nature-based carbon \nneutralization initiatives \nAddressing Health Equity\nAWS is harnessing the power of the cloud to advance health \nequity globally. Through the AWS Health Equity Initiative \n(HEI), AWS has pledged to provide up to $60 million in \ncloud computing credits to organizations that are using \ncloud computing technology to address health disparities \nthat impact underserved or underrepresented communities \naround the world. AWS has already awarded over $32 million \nand supported 229 global organizations to promote equal \naccess to health resources, up from 90 organizations in 2022.\nIn December 2023, AWS joined the Health Electrification and \nTelecommunications Alliance   (HETA), Power Africa’s    \ninitiative for health facility electrification and digital \nconnectivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Power Africa is part of the \nUnited States Agency for International Development  (USAID) \nand harnesses the collective resources of public and private \nsectors to expand electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. AWS \nhas pledged to support efforts across the initiative’s target \ncountries, contributing cash and AWS promotional credits \nto help health facilities keep the lights on for nighttime \nservices, reliably provide patients with oxygen and other \nlifesaving care, refrigerate vaccines and other temperature-\nsensitive medical commodities, and use the digital tools \nthat modern medicine relies on. AWS is also collaborating \nwith HETA to develop a cloud-based solution for real-time \nmonitoring, analytics, predictive maintenance of energy and \nconnectivity infrastructure.\n73\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

For regular full-time and part-\ntime employees, these benefits begin on the first day of \nemployment and include health care insurance coverage, \npaid parental leave, ways to save for the future, our \nupskilling programs, and other resources to improve health \nand well-being.\nIn 2023, Amazon invested nearly $10 billion in total \nemployee benefits. To meet employees’ needs, no matter \ntheir circumstances, we continued to expand our current \nofferings and introduce new ones. For example:\n•\t We launched new cross-border health plan options \nallowing employees who work in California to access \nhealth care in the Baja California region of Mexico. \n•\t In response to employee feedback indicating that they \nprefer the certainty of cost under a copay-based health \nplan over a more unpredictable coinsurance-based plan, \nwe converted our two most enrolled coinsurance plans \nto copay versions.\n•\t To make obtaining maintenance medication more \nconvenient for employees and support regimen \nadherence, Amazon increased the number of U.S. \npharmacies where employees can fill 90-day supplies. \nPreviously, 90-day supplies were restricted to a \ndesignated mail order pharmacy, while other pharmacies \nwere limited to filling up to 30-day supplies. \n•\t We provided access to mental health counselors \nvia live chat for employees in Australia, Costa Rica, \nIndia, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK. We also \ncompleted the global rollout of our partnership with \nCompensation and Financial \nSupport \nAmazon provides competitive compensation to reward \nemployees for their dedication and hard work. In 2023, \nwe announced pay increases for U.S. frontline employees, \nwith average pay for those in customer fulfillment and \ntransportation increasing from $19 to $20.50 per hour—\nan investment of $1.3 billion. Our investments have \nhad a positive influence on local communities across \nthe U.S., helping to grow household incomes and boost \nlocal economies. \nAmazon also invested $600 million in international wage \nincreases in 2023. In the UK, we committed to investing £170 \nmillion to increase the minimum starting hourly wage for \nour frontline operations employees between October 2023 \nand April 2024. By the end of 2023, we had increased the \nhourly wage in the UK to £12, representing a 14% increase in \nstarting pay over two years and a 26% increase since 2018. \nIn Germany, we increased the entry hourly wage for logistics \nemployees to €14, representing a 17% increase in average \nstarting pay since 2022 and a 30% increase since 2019. \nHourly wages automatically increase in Germany after 12 and \n24 months, with full-time employees earning an average of \n€37,000 per year after two years.\nWe also introduced a new financial assistance program and \nan emergency savings program   with Brightside in 2023 to \nfurther support our customer fulfillment and transportation \nemployees. Brightside is a financial care solution currently \nbeing piloted for hourly employees in select states across \nthe U.S., providing free and confidential solutions to those \nexperiencing financial challenges or looking to improve their \nfinancial health. Our Brightside Financial Care pilot program \nconnects Amazon associates with financial solutions and \nresources that enhance their control over their personal \nfinances. Personal coaches offer live support to participants \nand use dynamic technology to recommend customized \nplans to improve their financial health and maximize the \nbenefits available to them through Amazon. In 2023, nearly \n28,900 associates engaged in this pilot program across \n12 states. We plan to expand the program to all U.S. hourly \nemployees in 2024.\nMeanwhile, Brightside’s emergency savings fund \nprogram enables employees to prepare for life’s unexpected \nexpenses by building an emergency financial reserve. \nParticipants can set aside a portion of their paycheck \nautomatically and access the funds when they are most \nneeded. Employees who take advantage of this benefit \nincrease their financial resiliency and confidence each pay \nperiod as they see their savings account balance grow. \nTogether, these programs have provided $13.9 million worth \nof financial resources to employees, helping them contribute \n$7.4 million to savings accounts that can be used for \nunexpected expenses. \nPay Equity \nWe continue to prioritize pay equity among our employees. \nA review of our 2023 compensation, including base pay, cash \nbonuses, and stock, found that women in the U.S. earned \n99.9 cents and women globally earned 99.8 cents for every \ndollar men earned performing the same jobs. The review also \nshowed that racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. earned one \ndollar for every dollar white employees earned performing \nthe same jobs.\nTwill Therapeutics, which provides self-guided tools for \neveryday mental health to employees and their families. \n•\t We launched Flexible Benefits in India and Canada, \noffering diverse employee cohorts the freedom to \ndesign their benefits packages to cater to their unique \nneeds and those of their families. In India, we designed a \nFlexible Benefits program that effectively builds custom \nsolutions for our diverse, multigenerational workforce. \nRecognizing that one size does not fit all, the program \nempowers employees to tailor their health and wellness \nbenefits to align with their individual life stages and \ncircumstances. In Canada, we introduced a Flexible \nBenefits program designed to increase employee choice \nby offering a new flexible plan for extended health, \nvision, and dental coverage in addition to the current \nplan, which includes a health care spending account \n(HSA) contribution to cover out-of-pocket expenses. \n•\t Compassionate care services—our support for \nemployees and their dependents through difficult life \nevents—were expanded beyond the U.S. to 60 new \ncountries. These services include family bereavement \nsupport and free, confidential support to employees \nand their dependents who have been diagnosed with a \ncritical or terminal illness.\nAmazon solicits ongoing feedback from our workforce and \ninput from external partners to help ensure our health and \nwellness benefits meet the evolving needs of all employees. \nFor example, in 2023, we generally aligned our U.S. gender-\naffirming coverage with recommendations from the World \nProfessional Association for Transgender Health.\nGlobal Employee Assistance Program \nAlongside robust medical care, Amazon offers inclusive \nmental health support, including through our Employee \n77\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\n77\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report",

It is available 24/7 in most major world languages, \n100% confidential, and free of charge, with easily accessible \nservices including:\n•\t Counseling delivered by qualified mental health \nprofessionals, either in-the-moment—when it is \nneeded most—or through bookable, short-term, \nsolutions-focused counseling designed to help with a \nparticular issue\n•\t Dedicated pediatric program, delivering mental \nhealth support for children from 18 months old and \ntheir caregivers\n•\t Financial and legal wellness consultations \n•\t Personalized mindfulness, life, and wellness \ncoaching program\n•\t Validated referrals for external work/life services\n•\t Manager consultation services, including critical \nincident support\n•\t Range of self-serve assessment tools and access to a \ntopical webinar and information library via a customized \nwebsite or app \n•\t Access to behavioral health care, including five visits per \nissue per year (expanded from three visits in 2022)\nIn 2023, Amazon’s Workplace Options EAP was offered in \n59 countries, including four new ones: Estonia, Hungary, \nIndia, and Kenya. Globally, our EAP was available to nearly \n1.6 million employees in 62 countries.\nSupporting the Health of Amazon Employees \nand Their Families\nNavigating health care for family planning and fertility \ncan be challenging, which is why Amazon proudly \nprovides our U.S. employees—regardless of their gender, \nsexual orientation, or relationship status—with family-\nbuilding benefits. This benefit offers support with in \nvitro fertilization (IVF), egg freezing, genetic testing, and \nmore, and it supported nearly 30,400 full-time and hourly \nAmazon employees in 2023. Through this offering, our \nU.S. employees also receive access to approximately 1,070 \nfertility specialists. In 2023, Amazon received the National \nInfertility Association’s Award for Access, which recognizes \ncompanies whose work helps increase access to family-\nbuilding options for people living with infertility.\nWhen our employees are facing challenging times in terms \nof their health, we strive to be there to support them. In \n2023, we signed the Working with Cancer Pledge   to \nsignify our continued commitment to providing a supportive \nworkplace culture for employees with cancer. This pledge \nsignals Amazon’s dedication to providing leading health care \nbenefits and fostering compassion among managers and \nleaders across the company.\nLearn more about how we support our employees and their \nfamilies during cancer diagnosis, treatment, and recovery   \nFlexible Scheduling\nOperations employees have provided us feedback that they \nwant more flexibility in when and how they work. That’s \nwhy we offer various shift and schedule options, including \npermanent full- or part-time positions and seasonal work. \nOptions for morning, day, night, and weekend shifts are \nprovided, so employees can work during the times that best \nfit their circumstances. \nNot everyone has the same routine week to week. In \naddition to providing fixed schedules, we offer flexible \noptions   that let employees choose when and how \nmuch to work. Amazon’s Flexible Scheduling program lets \neligible employees choose their shift schedules using an \napp, letting them plan their workweeks in a way that suits \nthem. In 2023, over 116,200 hourly fulfillment employees \nused Flexible Scheduling (a 16% increase from 2022), \nincluding nearly 28,400 internal fixed-schedule associates \nwho transferred into the program. \nWorkforce Changes  \nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the difficult decision \nto eliminate 18,000 roles, with an additional 9,000 roles \neliminated in April 2023. Several of our businesses were \naffected by these decisions. We did not make these decisions \nlightly and were committed to providing support to ease \nthe transition out of Amazon. Employees whose roles were \neliminated received a separation payment, external job \nplacement support, and region-specific transitional health \ninsurance benefits, where applicable.\nEmployee Engagement in \nSustainability\nIn 2023, Amazon launched the Sustainable Amazonian (SAM) \nprogram to engage our corporate employees worldwide in \nadopting more sustainable practices, both in their day-to-day \njobs and outside of work. Approximately 7,540 employees \nsigned the SAM Pledge, which included making a \ncommitment to leave things better than they found them \nand completing a sustainability training. \nThrough Amazon’s Sustainability Ambassador \nprogram, operational employees across our business \nsupport sustainability projects—both on-site at Amazon \ncampuses and in their communities—as well as employee \nengagement reporting and educational events to inspire \nfellow employees and share best practices across teams, \nbusiness units, and locations. Nearly 9,300 employees \nparticipated in our Sustainability Ambassador program \nin 2023, spanning 24 chapters throughout 1,345 of our \nbuildings in our corporate, data center, and fulfillment \nnetworks. Examples of 2023 employee-led projects include:\n•\t Sustainability Ambassadors established a waste \ndiversion program for our EU Logistics organization that \nreduced waste by 1.4 grams per dispatched shipment, \nfor a total of 6 tons of waste avoided. The team’s waste \navoidance projects helped us divert 88% of waste from \nlandfills in 2023. \n•\t AWS Sustainability Ambassadors continued their \nimplementation of the LED Everywhere Project, an \ninitiative started in 2021 that aims to replace fluorescent \nor less energy-efficient lighting with LED alternatives \nin all AWS data centers. In 2023, 10,500 light bulbs \nwere replaced with LEDs, resulting in an energy use \nreduction of over 3,100 megawatt-hours (MWh) annually \ncompared to the old bulbs.\n•\t In the U.S., Sustainability Ambassadors partnered with \nthe Indigenous at Amazon global affinity group and \nAmazon in the Community to host an in-person panel \ndiscussion with internationally recognized Indigenous \nleaders at our Seattle headquarters. Their discussion \nlinked Indigenous wisdom, knowledge, and learnings to \nglobal sustainability efforts, with a focus on protecting \nour water resources.\nThe education of our employees is an important piece \nof our work to drive a culture that prioritizes \nsustainability across Amazon. In 2023, nearly \n51,300 employees engaged in sustainability education, \nand approximately 31,680 voluntarily completed internal \nsustainability training modules.\n78\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\n78\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report",

    "text": "Inclusive Experiences\nHealth and Safety\nEmployee Experience\nEmployee Communication \nChannels  \nMany of our best ideas come from Amazon employees. \nWe value their feedback—both positive sentiments and \nconstructive comments that can help us improve the \nemployee and customer experiences. \nAmazon uses various communication channels to maintain \nawareness of and responsiveness to changing dynamics, \nquestions, concerns, and ideas across our large global \nworkforce. This includes direct daily engagement, such as all-\nhands meetings with general managers, stand-up meetings \nwith direct supervisors, and other one-on-one meetings. \nEmployees can also voice concerns, anonymously report \npotential violations of Amazon’s Code of Business Conduct \nand Ethics, and ask questions about potentially unethical \nconduct through Amazon’s Ethics Line. If needed, employees \ncan access several other escalation mechanisms, including \nexecutive escalation and communication with their managers \nor human resources business partners. We actively encourage \nour employees to report any issues or concerns without fear \nof reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. \nMyVoice\nMyVoice, Amazon’s primary Voice of Associate platform, \nprovides a two-way communication channel between our \nglobal associates and their site leadership. This online tool \nallows employees to express concerns, offer suggestions, and \nask questions to leadership teams who will reply directly, \nenabling quicker, more collaborative issue remediation. \nGlobally, employees provided over 600,000 comments \nthrough MyVoice in 2023. \nWe also completed a foundational re-architecture of the \nMyVoice tool and integrated it within our A to Z employee \napp, creating a mobile experience for employees that is \nsimpler, is more user-friendly, and increases discoverability. \nOur enhancements to MyVoice also simplify the experience \nfor leaders, centralizing feedback and associated follow-up \nLooking Forward\nAmazon is always exploring new ways to enhance the \nemployee experience. We will continue focusing on upward \nmobility by offering technical and skills training for career \nadvancement and encouraging participation in our Career \nChoice program, which provides employees the opportunity \nto get prepaid college, GED, or English as a second language \n(ESL) tuition. Finally, as we strive to be Earth’s best employer, \nwe’ll seek to further integrate flexibility into how and when \nour employees work and will continue to offer competitive \ncompensation, financial support, and benefits. We’re eager to \nkeep improving our employee engagement efforts and build \neven more robust feedback mechanisms to ensure that our \nglobal workforce feels valued, heard, and appreciated.\nactions and making it easier for leaders to review comments \nand track actions.\nUsing the MyVoice mechanism, we continuously improve our \npolicies and practices based on workers’ suggestions. For \nexample, direct suggestions relating to time-tracking led \nto policy improvements that better served associate needs, \nprovided increased flexibility, and allowed for better work/\nlife balance. \nAt one fulfillment center in California, we received \nMyVoice feedback regarding difficulty in commuting to \nthe location. Taking this feedback into account, Amazon \npartnered with city and local officials to provide a better \nbus route and stop that would help alleviate the issue. \nMeanwhile, in India, leaders analyzed feedback from \nassociates related to leave management, resulting in the \nlaunch of a new, automatic, end-to-end leave management \nsystem, improved standardization, and, as a result, a better \nassociate experience.\nConnections \nConnections is Amazon’s real-time, companywide feedback \nmechanism designed to facilitate listening to and learning \nfrom employees at scale. Each day, employees can choose \nto respond to Connections questions—delivered in \n29 languages—via their computers, workstation devices, \nor hand scanners. Connections improves the employee \nexperience by identifying obstacles to meaningful work, \nsurfacing issues before they become acute problems, \nand highlighting strengths so they don’t become \nmissed opportunities.\nAcross Amazon, our employees generate more than \n1.6 million Connections responses across 60 countries \neach day. Connections analyzes and aggregates individual \nresponse data, sharing it with managers at the team \nlevel to maintain confidentiality. Managers can then take \nrelevant actions for improvement at the earliest opportunity \nto build trust with their teams. For example, as a result \nof Connections feedback that both career growth and \nperceptions of growth were important drivers of employee \nsatisfaction, Amazon introduced a new program allowing \nemployees and their managers to work together to drive \ncareer growth more effectively.\nAssociate Roundtables, Forums, and Safety \nCommittees\nAssociate Roundtables provide employees and managers \nwith a meaningful opportunity to discuss issues, ask \nquestions, and get immediate feedback in person. Amazon \nhosts these meetings around the globe, with their exact \ncadence varying by business line and site.\nAssociate Forums create opportunities for employees \nto connect with site leaders on decisions that affect \nthe site or employee experience. In 2023, we held \n146 Associate Forums.\nAssociate Safety Committees allow employees at various \nsites globally to offer input on relevant safety matters. In \n2023, 185,000 employees participated in over 25,000 Safety \nCommittee meetings, collectively developing 13,000 actions \nto increase on-site safety. \nAppeals \nAmazon maintains a defined appeals process for our \nemployees. Across the U.S. and Canada, eligible employees \ncan use an online, paperless appeals service to challenge \ncertain disciplinary actions. The applicable manager reviews \nthe claim to verify policies have been correctly applied. \nWhere this is not the case, appropriate remediation can then \nbe taken. \nLearn more about our approach to ethical business in our \nSustainability Reporting Framework Summary \nFreedom of Association \nWe respect freedom of association and our employees’ \nright to form, join, or not join labor unions or other lawful \norganizations of their choosing without fear of reprisal, \nintimidation, or harassment. These rights should be exercised \nin an informed and thoughtful manner. \nGlobally, Amazon applies or is party to dozens of collective \nbargaining agreements at national, regional, sectoral, \nand enterprise levels. In 2022, we established a European \nWorks Council, holding our first meeting in April 2023. \nThe European Works Council is composed of workers and \nemployer representatives and meets regularly to discuss \ntransnational company issues. \nLearn more about our respect for freedom of association in \nour Human Rights Commitment   \n80\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain\n80\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report",

We have established a series of feedback \nmechanisms to ensure we listen to our people on the front \nlines and incorporate their feedback on ways to improve \nsafety across our operations. \nSafety Observations\nOne method we use to take employee feedback and turn \nit into measurable action is Dragonfly. This tool—available \non employees’ devices and at kiosks on-site—empowers \nemployees to find and fix unsafe conditions or behaviors, \nescalate safety concerns, and suggest safety improvements \nduring the course of their work. Dragonfly informs site \nmanagers so they can take appropriate action. In 2023, we \nsuccessfully actioned over 200,000 Dragonfly observations \nto help make our sites safer. \nSafety Committees\nThroughout 2023, more than 185,000 employees \nparticipated in over 25,000 safety meetings whose purpose \nwas to gather feedback, describe new safety initiatives, and \nlisten to employee needs. These meetings resulted in more \nthan 13,000 follow-up actions, including simple items like \nreadjusting site mirrors to better align with walking paths \nand sharing reminders on how to safely move pallets.\nTraining Our Employees \nTraining is foundational to safety excellence. We are \nconstantly updating and enhancing our suite of trainings to \nensure they are effective and helpful for employees. \nOnboarding\nAll applicable new employees receive safety training on their \nfirst day of employment. In 2023, all of our newly hired \noperations employees took our safety onboarding training. \nThis covers ownership of safety, incident reporting and \ninvestigation, stop work authority, awareness for all safety \nprocedures, and an introduction to the safety management \nsystem. We also review emergency response preparedness \ntraining, which includes a site tour and a review of specific \nshelter-in-place and incident response procedures. To make \nsure that we are listening to employees’ feedback from \ntheir first day on the job, we ask whether their training has \nprepared them to perform their jobs safely. Nearly 89% of \nthose who responded to the survey told us that the training \nprepared them to do their jobs safely.\nSafety Leadership Index\nAnother tool that we use to measure and improve safety is \nthe Safety Leadership Index (SLI). SLI helps us get ahead of \nsafety risks by receiving information from our employees \nthrough a monthly rotation of questions that pop up on \nemployees’ scanners and computers when they log in for \nwork. Feedback is anonymous, confidential, and crucial to \ndriving continuous improvement. \nOur Leadership Principle “Strive to Be Earth’s Best Employer” \nchallenges us to create a safer, more productive, higher-\nperforming, more diverse, and more just work environment. \nIt reinforces that nothing is more important than the safety \nand well-being of our teams. \nWe aim to be the safest workplace in the industries in \nwhich we operate. To drive continuous improvement, we \nmeasure progress against both lagging indicators, such as \nincident rates, and leading indicators, such as employee \nsentiment. We have safety audits, inspections, and \nfeedback mechanisms in place at every Amazon facility. \nTogether, these steps provide us with a full picture of our \nworkplace safety.\nA risk management approach guides our prioritization and \ndecision-making. It includes:\n•\t Engaging employees to continuously improve safety in \nour operations.\n•\t Assessing safety processes and adherence to standards \nthrough audits and inspections.\n•\t Measuring safety performance to assess program \neffectiveness and identify and remove hazards.\n•\t Working with our operations partners to enhance safety \nacross our network. \n•\t Making targeted investments to enhance our \nsafety performance.\nA management system aligned with International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) 45001:2018—a \nvoluntary international standard for health and safety \nmanagement—helps guide our efforts in these areas.  \nIn 2023, we continued to invest in capital improvements, new \nsafety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered \nergonomic solutions. All of these actions aim to reduce risks \nand hazards for our employees, partners, and communities.\nContinuous Learning\nAfter orientation, training continues with routine reminders \ndelivered through daily stand-up meetings, notifications \nin the A to Z employee app, messages on TV screens in \nour buildings, alerts when logging on to a workstation, \ne-learning modules, and wall posters in restrooms, break \nrooms, and other common areas. We also coach small groups \nof employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and \nsafety through our Huddles program. Managers cover a \nrotating set of topics that includes proper body movement, \nconditioning, and best practices for gripping, handling \nobjects, lifting, carrying, and bending. Employees also receive \nother training based on their job duties, including training \nmodules specific to dock safety, powered industrial trucks, \nand first aid.\nAnnual Training\nEvery employee and manager participates in annual safety \ntraining, which reinforces concepts such as emergency \npreparedness and response, hazards and controls of the \nspecific jobs they are doing, safety coaching, identifying \nand reporting unsafe conditions and behaviors, and safety \nengagement. This goes beyond merely teaching someone the \nskills they need to complete a specific task. We incorporate \nreal-world scenarios, with practical opportunities to practice \nwhat they have learned. \nMixed Reality Training\nBeyond routine training, we invest in new technologies to \ncontinuously build safety skills and competencies. We are \npiloting promising mixed reality training for some higher-\nrisk jobs to simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled, safe \nenvironment. For example, we are testing a semi-immersive \n82\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

That is why we rigorously audit and inspect our sites \nto make sure our resources and protocols are helping us \neffectively identify, eliminate, or reduce safety hazards. In \n2023, we conducted almost 6.3 million inspections within \nour operations facilities globally, a 152% increase from \nthe 2.5 million conducted in 2020. We audited 240 sites \nacross Amazon. \nThese inspections and audits help us determine how to \naddress the various types of injury. One of the most common \ntypes of injury at any warehousing or transportation \ncompany is a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD), more \ncommonly known as a strain or sprain. Over the past four \nyears, the rate of recordable MSD injuries at Amazon has \nEvaluating Our Safety \nPerformance \nOur global operations network more than doubled in size \nbetween 2019 and 2023 to more than 1.1 million employees \nacross thousands of sites. \nWhile we still have work to do, we have made significant \nprogress on safety since 2019. From the beginning of \n2019 to the end of 2023, our global Recordable Incident \nRate (RIR) improved by 30% and our Lost Time Incident \nRate (LTIR) improved by 60%. These safety improvements \ncame in the face of particularly tumultuous world events, \nincluding a pandemic that disrupted operations for almost \nevery employer. Amazon’s safety performance continues to \nimprove year over year—from 2022 to 2023, we improved \nour RIR by 8% and our LTIR by 16%. We are pleased with our \nprogress but know we can do more. Each incident that occurs \nrepresents a person, and even one incident is too many.\nLearn more about how Amazon’s safety performance \ncontinues to improve year over year \nSafety in the United States\nIn the U.S., we report our operations data to the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration under \ntwo distinct industries: General Warehousing and Storage, \nand Courier and Express Delivery Services. The Bureau of \nLabor Statistics (BLS) determines industry averages for \neach industry based on the employers’ size and categorizes \nthem accordingly. BLS publishes averages each November, \nmeaning the 2022 averages published in November 2023 are \nthe most recent.\nSimilar to our global operations, we have made meaningful, \nmeasurable safety progress in the U.S. over the past four \nyears. In the General Warehousing and Storage industry, our \nRIR improved by 24% over the past four years. Amazon’s \n2023 rate is 6.5, which is better than the latest BLS average \nof 6.8 for employers our size (>1,000 employees).40 Our LTIR \nimproved by 77% over the past four years. Amazon’s 2023 \nrate is 1.1, which is better than the latest BLS average of \n2.6 for employers our size. \ntraining for our new forklift operators. Using 3D headsets to \nsimulate their jobs, operators learn how to pick orders in a \nsafe and efficient way before starting their roles. \nOur Partners \nOur delivery network is powered by thousands of small \nbusinesses and hundreds of thousands of drivers who \nleverage Amazon’s technology to improve on-road safety \nevery day. While our partners each provide robust programs \nfor their drivers, we offer additional safety resources and \ntraining for any delivery partner who wants to participate. \nFor example, to help drivers practice how to navigate safely \nin a variety of weather conditions, we created a commercial \ndriver simulator program that includes advanced simulations \nof potential ice, snow, heavy rain, wind, mechanical \nchallenges, and tire failures. \nIn the Courier and Express Delivery Services industry, our RIR \nimproved by 41% over the past four years. Amazon’s 2023 \nrate is 6.3, which is better than the latest BLS average of \n11.5 for employers our size (250–999 employees).41 Our LTIR \nimproved by 66% over the past four years. Amazon’s 2023 \nrate is 2.4, which is better than the latest BLS average of \n4.7 for employers our size.  \nimproved by 27%, but they still make up about 57% of \nall recordable injuries at Amazon. The remaining 43% of \nour recordable injuries were due to slips, trips, and falls, or \noccasional objects that came loose and fell. \nTo continue reducing MSD injuries, we have devoted \nconsiderable effort and resources to improve ergonomic \nconditions. In 2023, we invested in technology and \nworkspace modifications that specifically target MSD risk \nreduction. For example, we: \n•\t Introduced sophisticated computer algorithms in our \nfulfillment centers that direct employees to pick and \nstow products in ergonomic power zones—the area \nbetween the shoulder and mid-thigh. As a result, there \nwas an average 5% improvement in the cumulative \nforces acting on the lower back and an average \n7% improvement on shoulder movements.  \n•\t Implemented adjustable-height workstations at select \nfulfillment centers. \n•\t Deployed ergonomically redesigned packing stations at \nselect fulfillment centers.\n•\t Introduced self-adjusting carts that enable employees to \nhandle totes (plastic bins used to move products) in an \nergonomically friendly way.\n•\t Implemented job rotations, where employees are \ntrained in new roles and can rotate among jobs that \nuse different muscle-tendon groups, in some facilities. \nBy doing this, we help decrease repetitive motion and \nprevent muscle fatigue.\nEmployees work together to load packages.\n83\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

We have also continued to invest in robotics that \nhelp make our operations safer   by reducing employees’ \nworkloads. One example is Proteus, our first autonomous \nmobile robot, which helps move heavy objects and carts. \nAnother is Cardinal, a robotic arm that can quickly select a \nsingle package, read its label, and sort it. Both innovations \nhelp reduce repetitive tasks that can cause injuries such \nas MSDs and create a safer, more comfortable work \nenvironment for our employees year-round. We also plan \nfor factors that can impact our employees’ safety such as \nextreme weather. Our policies and procedures for addressing \nextreme heat and cold are robust and often exceed industry \nstandards and guidelines.\nWe are proud of our advancements in automation, and we \nsupplement this sophisticated technology with well-known \nforms of personal protection. For example, we require all \nemployees, partners, and visitors to wear safety shoes at our \nfacilities, as well as hard hats and impact-resistant gloves in \nspecific jobs. Mandating composite-toe safety shoes at our \nfacilities has helped reduce toe-related injuries by 85% since \n2022. We provide employees with a $110 voucher annually \nto acquire approved composite-toe shoes that fit their style \nand needs.\nIn addition, we have developed cutting-edge protective \nequipment for specific jobs. For example, we have developed \nintelligent safety vests for employees who maintain our \nrobots. These vests use short-range radio frequencies to send \nsignals to robots in real time. Robots in range automatically \nslow down, alter their route, and, at even closer range, stop \nentirely when they detect an employee is nearby. Once \nthe employee is out of range, the robot resumes normal \noperation. As another example, we use sensor technology \nembedded in cold weather gear for employees who work \nin our freezers, allowing us to keep an eye on the amount \nof time they spend working in cooler temperatures. If an \nemployee exceeds a specified amount of time, site personnel \nComparative Safety Data\nWorldwide LTIR:  \n60% improvement from 2019 to 2023\nWorldwide RIR:  \n30% improvement from 2019 to 2023\nU.S. RIR:  \n28% improvement from 2019 to 2023\nU.S. LTIR:  \n75% improvement from 2019 to 2023\nU.S. LTIR Comparison Data for \nGeneral Warehousing and Storage\nU.S. RIR Comparison Data for  \nGeneral Warehousing and Storage\nU.S. RIR Comparison Data for  \nCourier and Express Delivery Services\nU.S. LTIR Comparison Data for  \nCourier and Express Delivery Services\nBLS \nAverage\nBLS \nAverage\nBLS \nAverage\nAmazon \nU.S. Only\nAmazon \nU.S. Only\nAmazon \nU.S. Only\nAmazon \nU.S. Only\nAmazon \nU.S. Only\nAmazon \nU.S. Only\n6.8\n11.5\n2.6\n6.9\n7.0\n1.1\n6.5\n6.3\n1.1\nBLS \nAverage\nAmazon \nU.S. Only\nAmazon \nU.S. Only\n4.7\n3.6\n2.4\n2022\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2022\n2022\n2022\n2022\n2023\n2023\n2023\n6.7\n5.1\n5.1\n4.7\n5.7\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n8.7\n4.0\n5.1\n6.5\n2.3\n2.6\n6.7\n1.9\n1.6\n6.3\n1.6\n1.3\n7.6\n2.2\n2.3\n2019\n2019\n2019\n2020\n2020\n2020\n2021\n2021\n2021\n2022\n2022\n2022\n2023\n2023\n2023\n84\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

For example, we collaborate with small \nbusiness owners called delivery service providers (DSPs) and \nwith independent contractors called Amazon Flex delivery \npartners to deliver packages to customers’ doorsteps. We \nalso work with independent long-haul trucking companies to \nmove products across our network.\nOur transportation operations blend Amazon’s advanced \ntechnology and safety initiatives to transport packages \nacross our network of fulfillment centers, sort centers, \nand delivery stations, and to our customers. As our \ntransportation operations have expanded, we have focused \non making our docks and roads safer through innovative \nmobile and vehicle technology. \nFreight Network\nOur trucking fleet of company-owned and independent \nlong-haul vehicles has advanced safety technology including \nfront-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, \nstability control, side-object detection, adaptive cruise \ncontrol, and speed limiters. Drivers in North America and \nEurope receive enhanced and up-to-date route forecasts \nto help them stay informed of inclement weather. The \ninformation can be accessed at any time, and forecasts are \nupdated every 10 minutes to help them alter their route if \nneeded. Drivers in North America also receive automated \nwarnings if the technology detects their vehicle is stopped on \na major road. The technology urges them to move to a safer \nlocation, if possible. \nDelivery Network \nWhile our partners report their own safety data to \nregulators, we are committed to helping them keep their \nemployees safe. To that end, we offer them access to \nsafety resources, training, and technologies. One example \nis third-party technology in delivery vans that measures \nand monitors unsafe driving behaviors such as speeding, \ndistraction, and failure to wear a seat belt or obey a road \nsign. If the technology consistently detects these behaviors, \ndrivers receive a notification when they stop their vehicle \nfor their next delivery. The technology also sends related \nnotifications to the drivers’ employers—the DSPs—who are \nencouraged to coach the drivers. Since we have incorporated \nthis technology into our branded vehicles, DSP drivers’ \ncollision rates have declined nearly 40%. From 2022 to 2023, \nits use has reduced unsafe DSP driving behaviors by 62% in \nthe U.S.\nAs the weather gets warmer, preparedness and prevention \nare paramount to the health and safety of our operations \nteams and delivery partners. In advance of higher \ntemperatures, we use best-in-class technology, amenities, \nand preventive measures to help keep drivers safe. For \nexample, all Amazon-branded vehicles are equipped with \nair conditioning—a feature that is well above industry \nstandards. We are also on track to retrofit our full fleet of \ncargo vans and electric delivery vehicles with insulation that \nreduces the internal temperature of the back of our vehicles \nby up to 15% by the end of 2024.\nIncreasingly, more package deliveries are made overnight, \nwhen traffic is lighter and drivers can more safely navigate \nacross communities. In 2023, we created an in-app safety \nfeature that allows drivers to message customers and \nremind them to turn on porch lights, secure pets, and clear \nthe pathway of hazards. We have also piloted a safe and \nnon-intrusive Dog-Distancing Device—a hand-held unit \nwith ultrasonic sounds and strobe lights that drivers can \nuse when they come in contact with an animal at a delivery \nlocation. The device is intended to distract aggressive dogs \nand help delivery drivers create space between themselves \nLooking Forward\nAs we look to the future, we plan to continue investing \nheavily in employee health and safety across our operations. \nIn 2024 alone, we plan to invest over $750 million in \ntechnologies, resources, training, and programs to further \nour safety efforts. This includes more than $400 million \nreceive a real-time alert to check on the employee and \nencourage them to take a break. Since introducing this \ntechnology in 2022, we have not had a single recordable \ninjury related to overexposure in freezers.\nand the animals when needed. Based on initial success, we \nhave expanded the test to deploy the devices to the drivers \nwho most frequently report encountering dogs during their \ndeliveries.\nfor process engineering and retrofit initiatives that improve \nergonomics, more than $150 million in additional forklift \nsafety controls, more than $100 million for on-the-road \nsafety enhancements, and more than $80 million for truck \nyard safety improvements.\nWe made meaningful, measurable progress in 2023, and \nwe are working hard to build on those achievements. While \nwe’re proud of the progress we have made, we know that \nthere is more work to do on our journey to become the safest \nemployer in the industries in which we operate, and this \ndrives our commitment to continue improving safety for our \nemployees, partners, and communities every day.\n85\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

We are evolving our \napproach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) work by \nshifting to a more scalable, long-term view through three new \nmental models. This new strategy enables us to accelerate \nprogress on our priorities and create inclusive experiences at \nscale. The mental models that guide our work are:\n•\t Bolted-on DEI programs, which drive inclusive and \nequitable outcomes within our business operations. An \nexample of a bolted-on program is diversity training, \nwhich teaches our employees to take more intentionally \ninclusive actions at work. \n•\t Built-in solutions, which are embedded into existing \nproducts to drive equitable experience and outcomes. \nFor example, the captions and dialogue boosts in \nPrime Video are built-in solutions, which create a more \naccessible experience for customers who are hard \nof hearing. \n•\t Born-inclusive solutions, which we define as building \nequity and inclusion into the architecture of a product \nor technology from the start. Examples of this include \naspects of product design, such as accessibility.\nMore built-in and born-inclusive solutions will be required \nto accelerate progress on our priorities and create inclusive \nexperiences at scale.\nLearn more about Amazon’s approach to inclusion on our \nglobal DEI website \nAs we deliver on our goals and make progress on our \npriority commitments, we continue reaching across \ncultures to connect our diverse world. We use our size, \nspeed, and innovation to unite us in new and exciting ways, \nincorporating inclusion into everything we do. \nOur Employees, Customers, and Communities\nTogether at Amazon\nWe want all Amazon employees to feel that they belong. \nThat is why we support programs that connect our \nemployees globally through shared experiences. For \nexample, Connect@Amazon is an employee engagement \norganization that hosts a variety of events for all full-time \nemployees, such as career summits, volunteer activities, \ncultural gatherings, and professional networking. In 2023, \nConnect@Amazon hosted events across 33 chapters with \n80,000 participants worldwide.\nEmployees can also participate in networking programs that \norganize learning opportunities, lead service projects, and \nhost activities around cultural celebrations. In 2023, nearly \n148,200 employees across more than 2,500 chapters in 60 \ncountries participated in one or more of our affinity groups. \nAWS employees can take part in the Inclusive Ambassador \nprogram, which is dedicated to scaling an inclusive, fair, and \nrespectful culture at AWS. More than 19,000 AWS employees \nacross 52 chapters globally participated in the Inclusive \nAmbassador program in 2023. \nLearn more about Amazon’s affinity groups   \nLGBTQIA+ at Amazon\nWe are committed to supporting and creating inclusive \nexperiences for LGBTQIA+ employees and communities \naround the globe. To advance development and recruitment \nefforts, Amazon strengthened key external LGBTQIA+ \npartnerships and fostered new ones.

As part of our \nefforts, we are building a strong pipeline of emerging diverse \ntalent through educational programs. \nIn 2023, more than 300 employees volunteered through the \nAmazon Hardware, Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and \nDevices (AHEAD) program, which gives primary and high \nschool science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) \nstudents hands-on learning through a custom curriculum \nenhanced by Amazon innovation. AHEAD helps historically \nunderrepresented students and their families understand \nthe pathways to high-tech fields by connecting them with \nAmazon employees who can share their own career journeys, \nguidance, and lessons learned. \nWe also welcomed 89 youth apprentices in 2023 to Amazon \nJumpStart, a program that employs emerging talent from \nhigh schools in underserved communities. Seven different \nAmazon organizations—Devices & Services, Amazon \nAdvertising, AWS, Worldwide Amazon Stores, Finance, Audio, \nand Twitch & Games—provided apprentices with on-the-job \nlearning experiences.\nDeveloping Diverse Talent\nThroughout 2023, Black, Latino/e, and women senior \nleaders across Amazon partnered with our hiring teams to \nsupport the continuous expansion of our external talent \nnetworks by investing in conferences and organizations \nsuch as Afro Tech, Association of Latino Professionals for \nAmerica (ALPFA), Black Men Xcel, Latinas in Tech, Society \nof Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and Women in \nTech. Amazon senior leaders participated in roundtable \ndiscussions and network-building and affinity-based events, \nand they engaged in recruiting partnerships—all to increase \nbrand awareness, engage diverse talent, and drive expanded \ninteraction with prospective external employees and leaders. \nAs we build our talent communities, we aim to create \nspace for our leaders and employees to come together and \nshare experiences and learn about Amazon. For example, \nthe Líderes sponsorship program equips participants with \nthe skill to create a personalized career growth plan that \nbuilds on the unique needs of Latino/e talent and creates \nopportunities for participants to have sustained exposure to, \nand advocacy from, senior leaders.\nAccelerating Inclusive Experiences \nGlobally\nWe are delivering inclusive experiences for our employees, \ncustomers, and communities in over 60 countries around \nthe world.\n87\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

In September 2023, we began \na partnership with the National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH) to raise awareness of their All of Us \nResearch Program, an effort to collect and study \ndata from people living in the U.S. to build one \nof the most diverse health databases in history. \nThis initiative focuses on accelerating precision \nmedicine research, increasing health equity, \nand providing DNA results to participants. In \nsupport of this work, All of Us works closely with \norganizations with deep ties to communities \nthat have been historically underrepresented in \nbiomedical research. \nWe were NIH’s first corporate health equity \npartner. In 2023, more than 1,300 Amazon \nemployees have either visited the All of Us \nwebsite or interacted directly with All of Us staff \nto learn more about the program, and more \nthan 200 Amazon employees have participated \nin this landmark study. Of the participants who \njoined a kickoff event at our second corporate \nheadquarters in Arlington, Virginia, 79% are \nfrom communities that have been historically \nunderrepresented in biomedical research.\nAccelerating Equitable Health Research\nA variety of organizations recognized Amazon \nas a great place to work in 2023. Some \nof the recognitions we received as a top \nemployer include:\n•\t Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate \nEquality Index: 100/100 for the sixth year in \na row\n•\t Disability Equality Index: 100/100 in 2022 \nand 2023 and a Best Place to Work for \nDisability Inclusion for the sixth year in a row\n•\t LinkedIn Top Companies U.S. Edition: No. 1 \nfor the third year in a row \n•\t Business Disability Forum’s Disability Smart \nTechnology Award\n•\t The Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health: \nPlatinum\n•\t Purple Certification from the Purple \nMethod: Received top score of 100 on \nour corporate approach to preventing \nworkplace harassment\nAwards and Recognitions\nInclusive Experiences\nHealth and Safety\nEmployee Experience\nIn the U.S., we signed our first memorandum of \nunderstanding (MOU) with a tribal nation in 2023, \nformalizing our collaboration with the Confederated Tribes \nof the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR). Under the MOU, \nAmazon will consult with the CTUIR, review their input, and \nimplement risk mitigation processes for projects that should \nconsider natural resources, areas of traditional or current use, \nand cultural or historic sites.\nSupporting Black, Latino, and Diverse Businesses\nAmazon is committed to supporting Black, Latino, and \ndiverse businesses and wants to see them succeed. We \ndeliver and invest in tools and resources that empower \nbusiness owners to grow and, in turn, create positive impact \nin their local communities. \nIn 2023, as part of our efforts to boost and support \nearly-stage, Black, Latino, and other underrepresented \nentrepreneurs, Amazon Catalytic Capital invested in six new \nventure capital funds. Catalytic Capital is a $150 million fund \ncommitted to investing in venture capital funds, accelerators, \nincubators, and venture studios that support Black, Latino, \nand other historically underrepresented entrepreneurs. These \nnew investments helped us meet our goal to support 10 \nfunds and accelerators and, in turn, fund 200 companies by \nthe end of 2023.\nLearn more about Catalytic Capital \nWe are also creating opportunities for alignment with \nthe greater community through programs such as our \nBlack Business Accelerator   (BBA), which was launched \nin 2021 as our first growth accelerator. Backed by a $150 \nmillion commitment from Amazon over four years, the BBA \nis dedicated to assisting Black-owned businesses in building \nsustainable growth on Amazon’s store. It provides a range of \ncomprehensive educational, discoverability, and community \nresources for certified Black-owned U.S. businesses with \nprofessional seller accounts at our store. In 2023, the BBA \nprovided 274 businesses with account management and \nfinancial assistance to accelerate their journey to launch \nand scale their businesses. Through the BBA, Amazon has \nincreased the unique selection of products we bring to \nour customers while creating a network with the Black \nbusiness community to better understand and support their \nentrepreneurial endeavors.\nAnother example is the AWS Impact Accelerator, a \n$30 million fund that provides Black, Latino/e, women, and \nLGBTQIA+ founders with equitable access to funds, training, \nmentorship, tools, and resources. In 2023, 20 companies \nparticipated in the AWS Impact Accelerator Latino Founders \nCohort, giving pre-seed Latino/e founders the support they \nneed to accelerate their businesses.\nLearn more about our efforts to support diverse  \nbusinesses \nAdvancing DEI through \nTechnology \nAmazon is creating inclusive technology that connects our \ndiverse world, disrupting the status quo of how we learn, \ncommunicate, and live.\t\n \nInnovating for Accessibility\nIn everything we do, we work backward from our customers. \nThis includes offering more devices and services with built-\nin accessibility solutions to better support our customers \nwith disabilities. Within Amazon’s devices and entertainment \nbusinesses, we continue to build and expand accessibility \nfeatures in our products, from Alexa and Fire TV to Audible \nand Prime Video. For example, we offer Alexa Voice Service \n(AVS) to commercial device makers such as original design \nmanufacturers and systems integrators, who use it to build \nAlexa into smart speakers, headphones, PCs, TVs, vehicles, \nand smart home products. We also launched Voice Access, a \nnew accessibility feature for our Fire HD 10, in October 2023. \nVoice Access allows customers who can speak English, but \ncannot use their hands to touch the screen, to control their \nFire tablet with their voice.\n91\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \nAppendix\nPeople\nOverview\nEnvironment\nValue Chain",

In 2023, we sponsored Indigenous in AI’s annual \nLakota AI Code Camp  . This three-week camp introduces \nLakota youth to coding and combines Lakota culture with \nAI to foster the preservation and reinvigoration of the \nLakota language. \nWe also awarded scholarships totaling $500,000 to \n125 students through AmazonNext, a college partnership \nprogram supporting undergraduate students in pursuing \nSTEM majors. Additionally, our Amazon Future Engineer \nprogram continues to provide access to childhood-to-career \ncomputer science education, focusing on students from \nunderrepresented and historically disenfranchised people \nand communities. \nLearn more about our Amazon Future Engineer program   \nInnovating for Customer Fulfillment and \nTransportation Employees \nAmazon is developing new technologies that help our \ncustomer fulfillment and transportation employees \nconnect, learn, and communicate at their place of work. \nFor example, in 2023, more than 450,000 employees in our \ncustomer fulfillment centers used SayHi, a tool to facilitate \ncommunication among colleagues facing language barriers. \nThrough SayHi, employees can access 72 languages and \n114 dialects to eliminate linguistic obstacles and engage in \nmultilingual conversations without the need for dedicated \ntranslators. Additionally, more than 150,000 employees \nacross our fulfillment centers leveraged the Encompass tool, \na DEI resource hub that provides employees with information \non affinity groups, upcoming cultural events, and more. \nIn 2023, Amazon Fire TV expanded its audio streaming capabilities to include cochlear implants.\nidentify as deaf, disabled, or neurodiverse.

This award recognizes our \nwork to develop technology that improves the lives and \nexperiences of people living with disabilities. The judges \nnoted the breadth of our innovation and global reach, as well \nas our use of employee and customer feedback to inform \nthe design, development, and delivery of our products \nand services.\nInclusive Experiences\nHealth and Safety\nEmployee Experience\nLooking Forward\nThe opportunity ahead of us to incorporate inclusion into \neverything we do at Amazon is greater than ever.

The VP of EHS&S reports events directly to \nthe BoD. \nTesla conducts an annual Enterprise Risk Assessment \n(ERA) that integrates ESG-related risks by engaging in \ninterviews and surveys with members of management \nacross the organization, including key stakeholders in \nsustainability. Through this exercise, climate-related \nrisks would be flagged to the relevant leadership team \nfor management. \nBeginning with Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg \nand \nGigafactory Texas in 2021, we initiated site-specific \nreviews to identify physical climate-related \nrisks that were \nthen addressed during the design process of those \nfactories. In 2022, this was followed by a systematic \nassessment of our entire manufacturing portfolio and any \nnew locations. \nToday, we continue to ensure that our current and future \nsites are prepared for the potential physical impacts of \nclimate change by integrating assessments into \nconsiderations for site design and future expansion plans. \nUsing the results from these analyses, Tesla is actively \nworking to harden our current and planned manufacturing \nportfolio against medium and long-term climate impacts. \nOver time, we will begin to evaluate other assets such as \nour Sales, Service and Delivery network as well as our \ncharging infrastructure and other relevant assets. \nAs regulations around GHG emissions management \nevolve, we may need to make further capital investments \nthat are different from or accelerated relative to existing \nplans, which may impact profitability.

Additionally, the number of controls in Nevada \nincreased to nearly half of the total HVAC infrastructure. \nThe Al Control policy enables HVAC systems within each \nGigafactory to work together to process sensor data, \nmodel Gigafactory dynamics and apply control actions \nthat safely minimize the energy required to support \nproduction. Al Control is primarily deployed on systems \nthat heat or cool critical Gigafactory production spaces \nand equipment. To ensure safe operation, Al Control \ncontinuously communicates with the preexisting standard \ncontrol logic of each system. In the event of any Al Control \nerror, each system seamlessly reverts to standard control. \nAs a result, as of 2023, there have been zero safety \nincidents or production interruptions related to Al Control. \nOptimizing Battery Cell Manufacturing \nIn order to reduce the cost of our vehicles and batteries, \nwe also need to use less energy to produce them. Tesla \nhas an innovative approach to manufacturing cells using a \ndryelectrode process. Current electrode production \nprocesses involve mixing liquids with cathode or anode \npowders and using massive machinery to coat and dry the \nelectrode. Since this process involves large ovens, today's \ncell production consumes a lot of energy. The \ndryelectrode process allows for the direct transition from \na cathode or anode powder to an electrode film, reducing \nenergy consumption in the overall cell manufacturing \nphase by more than 70% based on our latest analysis. \n46",

In 2023, we \nintroduced various efficiency processes within our \nwater-intensive \npaint shops to reduce overall water \nconsumption at Gigafactory Texas. \nRainwater and Condensate Harvesting and Reuse \nWe are planning to capture at least 25°/o of roof runoff \nin a central underground storage system in Gigafactory \nTexas. Rainwater will be recycled for use in the cooling \nof manufacturing equipment. In an average year, such \nsystems should save an estimated 14 million gallons of \npotable city water. Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor \nair is conditioned, water condenses out of the air. \nTypically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater. \nAt Gigafactory Texas, we plan to use this condensate \nin our cooling towers and process water systems to \noffset incoming site water. Based off latest estimates, \nthis could result in 13.6 million gallons of water \nconserved annually. \nA note about water usage and power generation \nIt's important to note the dual benefits of our solar energy products in \nreducing GHGs and minimizing water consumption. While the impact of \npower generation on emissions is widely recognized, its effect on water \nusage often goes unnoticed. Power generation ranks among the top \ncauses of water withdrawal in the U.S., as water for thermoelectric \npower \n48 \nReclaimed and Recycled Water \nThe \"cooling tower makeup\" is the single biggest \ncontributor to water usage in a vehicle factory after paint \noperations. As water that cools machinery evaporates, it \nneeds to be topped up regularly. The total cooling tower \nmakeup could be offset entirely by non-potable sources \nsuch as rainwater or wastewater. Using locally treated \nwastewater could result in offsetting the entire annual \n\"cooling tower makeup\" water demand with non-drinkable \nuses. We have started using reclaimed water for our \nlandscape irrigation needs at Gigafactory Texas. Once \nfully deployed, we expect this to save just under 150 \nmillion gallons of potable city water annually. \nis used to generate electricity with steam-driven turbine generators and \nto cool power-producing \nequipment.

This enables us to address critical \nareas within our supply chain more effectively. \nTesla requests all suppliers in the battery supply chain \nto provide annual GHG emissions footprints, either \nthrough our GHG Survey, an ISO-certified facility \nfootprint or an ISO-certified and third-party \nreviewed \nLCA. We also provided supplier-facing \nguidelines for \nLife Cycle Inventory Analysis (LCIA). In 2023, we also \nbegan requiring suppliers to provide GHG reduction \nplans and progress updates, with science-aligned \nreduction targets set at the cell, cathode, and refining/ \nsmelting levels. \nIn addition to getting primary data from suppliers, we \ncreate process-specific \nestimates of remaining \nemissions data. These were identified as hotspots \nthrough prior analyses. \nIn 2024, Tesla will work closely with suppliers to develop \nGHG reduction targets and roadmaps. \nBased on the supplier data we will continue to collect, \nwe aim to work with suppliers to develop site-specific \ndecarbonization plans, while designing and sourcing for \nlow-impact cells and increasing the share of recycled \nmaterial.

Our nickel-based cathodes \n(NMC and NCA) contain cobalt, but others, like our \niron-based cathodes (LFP), do not. While our nickel-\nbased cathodes will continue to need cobalt, they \ncontain less cobalt than similar cathode chemistries in \nthe industry, and we are increasing our use of cobalt-\nfree iron-based batteries, particularly for energy \nstorage and standard range products. \nBy mapping our supply chain, we know where our \ncobalt comes from-and \nwe only purchase cobalt from \nlarge-scale mines. Our direct suppliers undergo third-\nparty audits to ensure no child labor happens at these \nmines and no material from unauthorized sources \nenters our supply chain. Four audits were conducted \nin 2023* and found no instances of child labor at our \ndirect suppliers' sites. Our suppliers took action on all \nthe social performance findings of the audits and \neither completed the corrective action plan or have a \ndetailed plan in progress. \nIn addition, we worked with our supplier Glencore to \nlaunch a publicly available satellite monitoring system of \nits Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) operation located in \nthe DRC.

We buy aluminum in the form of sheet, ingot, \ncastings, extrusions, forgings and foil. It shows up in \nmany systems in the car-from \nTesla's body \nGigacastings to the batteries. Most of our aluminum is \nalloyed - meaning it is mixed with other elements to \noptimize engineering properties. The rising total \ndemand for aluminum means that increased recycling \nis not enough to reach a truly sustainable aluminum \nsector. Therefore, we engage with producers of both \nrecycled and primary material. \nDirect Sourcing and Supply Chain Mapping \nWe source much of the aluminum used in our vehicles \ndirectly from smelters/secondary \naluminum producers \n-sending \nthe material to Tesla plants or to our Tier 1 \nsuppliers. This, combined with our efforts of mapping \nupstream material sources where we don't directly \nsource the raw material, enables increased visibility \nand ability to conduct due diligence. \n8 \nIn 2024, Tesla committed to the ASI for \nour aluminum foundry in Lathrop, CA \nCertification \nAs a pre-requisite for being awarded new business, \nTesla continues to ask its suppliers to certify to the \nAluminium Stewardship Initiative's (ASI) Performance \nStandard. As of the first quarter of 2024, 92% of \nCybertruck aluminum suppliers are certified or \nworking towards this certification. \nOver 80% of all \naluminum Tier 1 suppliers are similarly certified or \nworking towards this certification. \nASI is one of the key industry organizations developing \ncredible decarbonization roadmaps for the aluminum \nindustry. We appreciate that no certification replaces \ndue diligence. We continue to work with ASI, \nsuppliers, and stakeholders to address and reduce \nrisks in our aluminum supply chain in recognition of its \noutsized impact. \nConfirmed Upstream Supplier Locations \n• Bauxite Mining: Australia, China, Guinea, Iceland, \nIndonesia, Solomon Islands* \n• Smelting: Australia, Canada, China, Germany, \nNorway, Malaysia, UAE, U.S. \n*The purchase of bauxite from the Solomon Islands occurred before 2020. \nWe include it in this list for transparency, but our strategy is to not further \nprocure bauxite from the Solomon Islands. \nOther Risk Mitigation Efforts \nIn 2023, we directly engaged key mid-tier, direct-\nsourced smelters, including visits of senior leadership \nrepresentatives to two of the world's largest smelters, \nduring which we evaluated the decarbonization \nroadmaps of all smelters in our European supply base \nand aligned on strategies to decarbonize. Tesla also \nparticipated in a data pilot as part of RMl's Horizon \nZero working group on aluminum which focused on \ncapturing embedded emissions data for aluminum, \nautomating data transfer processes of environmental \ndata, and capturing additional pertinent data such as \npercentage of post-industrial \nand post-consumer \nscrap percentages. \n127",

The \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a country of \nparticular relevance to the mineral trade, has been in \nconflict for almost three decades, sustained through the \ntrade of minerals. Too often the minerals leave the country \nbut don't come back-a one way street. In acknowledging \nthe consequences of mining operations, we initiated our \nTesla Tech for Good product donation project, aimed at \nmitigating adverse human rights impacts of mining while \nsimultaneously driving GHG reductions. During a 2022 trip \nto East Africa, Tesla pursued opportunities \nto apply our \ntechnology to mitigate adverse impacts of supply chain \noperations, provide remedy for harm caused, and \nmaximize positive impact for people and the planet. \nWe met with Panzi Hospital & Foundation, a center of \nexcellence in the DRC that provides holistic treatment for \nsurvivors of sexual violence-a \ntactic used by armed actors \nto perpetuate conflict, gain greater access to resources \nand control smuggling routes. \nPanzi has touched the lives of more than 80,000 survivors \nof sexual violence, including those affected by wartime, \nand another 25,000 women with serious gynecological \ninjuries. In collaboration with Panzi and based on their \nrenewable energy strategy, in early 2024 Tesla donated ten \nPowerwalls and hardware accessories to be installed at one \nof Panzi's clinics in the DRC. \nTesla and Panzi share the belief that everyone should have \naccess to sustainable, modern, and clean energy to meet \ntheir decarbonization \ngoals and address energy insecurity \n-especially \nthose who are providing life-saving healthcare. \n131 \nThe Powerwalls will enable Panzi to work even in times of \nenergy loss and avoid costs associated with running \ndiesel-fuel generators. In recognition that many social \nimpact initiatives fail to provide long-term solutions, to \nsupport sustaining impact of the project, we have \ncommitted to fund maintenance costs on the equipment \nfor the next ten years. \nTesla continues to seek opportunities \nto collaborate with \norganizations close to mining communities to find \ntransformative \nsolutions and address harm associated \nwith supply chain activities. A sustainable future is one in \nwhich the rights of everyone are respected and included \nin a just energy transition.",

Joining SMSDC as a corporate \nmember supports ongoing efforts to identify and \nincrease spend with HUB suppliers. \nMoreover, ongoing corporate member training \nservices will further strengthen Tesla's Sourcing for \nSocial Impact program to be in alignment with best \npractices while building relationships with Austin-\narea stakeholders. \nInternal Stakeholder Engagement \nLed sourcing organization wide training on Sourcing \nfor Social Impact-covering \nthree learning \nobjectives: 1) explain why sourcing for impact \nmatters, 2) identify resources to search for suppliers \nand track spend and 3) commit to at least one action \nwhich contributes to Tesla's Sourcing for Social \nImpact program. \nLaunched Sourcing for Social Impact Steering \nCommittee comprised of buyers, supply chain \nleadership and global sustainability teams to provide \nstakeholder advisory support, guidance and \nstrategic oversight of the program to ensure its \nsuccess by embedding initiative objectives across \nsourcing teams. \n137",

It \nprovides us with the ability to have an independent \nassessment of our direct supplier's performance to our \nSupplier Code of Conduct. Our requirement of Corrective \nAction Plans for non-conformances \nidentified during the \naudit also means we are contributing to tangible \nimprovements in the lives of workers at our suppliers' \nfacilities, regardless of being employees or contract \nworkers, as well the processes and management systems \nat supplier facilities. Our own audit team continued to \nattend a large portion of on-site audits, including 50% of \ninitial audits, to stress the importance of the program and \nensure Tesla's quality expectations were met. \nAs part of our quality assurance process, Tesla \nimplemented an auditor training program, reviewing \nTesla's process and requirements with auditors approved \nto conduct audits for Tesla. These trainings involved 134 \nauditors and included a comprehension test at its \nconclusion. \nWe also began incorporating upstream supplier audit \nresults into our CSR audit program, a recognition that our \nresponsibility does not stop at tier 1 suppliers and that we \nmust continue to promote best practices throughout the \nsupply chain. We hold these audits to the same standard: \naudits conducted to the RBA's audit checklist and by an \nindependent firm approved by the RBA. \nWe strengthened our already stringent expectations of \nInitial Audits \n156 \nsuppliers for what is considered sufficient to pass an audit. \nUntil 2023, this included only the requirement of zero \nClosure Audits \n73 \npriority non-conformances \nto avoid a closure audit. In \n2023 we added the expectation that suppliers have a \nWorkers Impacted by Audits \n73,065 \nscore of 60% or higher, otherwise they must undergo a \ncomplete re-audit of their facility within one year. \nCountries included in audits \n11 \n139",

(Tesla) that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions metrics for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023, in management's assertion are \npresented in accordance with the assessment criteria set forth in \nmanagement's assertion. Tesla's management is responsible for its \nassertion and for the selection of the criteria, which management \nbelieves provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the \nGHG emissions metrics. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion \non management's assertion based on our review. \nOur review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards \nestablished by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants \n(AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation \nEngagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those \nstandards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain \nlimited assurance about whether any material modifications should be \nmade to management's assertion in order for it to be fairly stated. The \nprocedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and \nare substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of \nwhich is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management's \nassertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an \nopinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. \nBecause of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of \nassurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the \nassurance that would have been obtained had an examination been \nperformed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient \nand appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion. \nWe are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical \nresponsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements \nrelated to the engagement. \nThe firm applies the Statements on Quality Control Standards \nestablished by the AICPA. \nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional \njudgment. In performing our review, we performed inquiries, \nperformed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations on a \nsample basis, read relevant policies to understand terms related to \nrelevant information about the GHG emissions metrics, reviewed \nsupporting documentation in regard to the completeness and \naccuracy of the data in the GHG emissions metrics on a sample basis, \nand performed analytical procedures. \npwc \nGHG emissions quantification \nis subject to significant inherent \nmeasurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emissions \nfactors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG \nemissions, and the inability of these models, due to incomplete \nscientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under \nall circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the \nresultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use data used in \nGHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given \nthe nature and the methods used for measuring such data. The \nselection by management of different but acceptable measurement \ntechniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or \nmetrics being reported. \nAs discussed in management's assertion, Tesla has estimated GHG \nemissions for certain emissions sources for which no primary usage \ndata is available. \n152 \nBased on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications \nthat should be made to Tesla's management assertion in order for it to \nbe fairly stated. \nSan Jose, California \nApril 25, 2024",

Stationary combustion (natural gas): \n• Combustion from stationary equipment and \nmachinery. \n• Global natural gas usage data was collected from \nmonthly utility invoices obtained from third-party \nproviders. \n• If usage data was not available, Tesla estimated the \nnatural gas usage by determining an annual natural \ngas usage rate per square foot based on actual \n2023 monthly natural gas usage data for sites in a \nsimilar geographic location and type of site. This \nrate was then multiplied by the square footage of \nthe site building space. \n• Emission factors: United States (U.S.) \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Emission \nFactors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2023. \nb. Stationary and mobile combustion \n(propane, diesel, and gasoline): \n• Combustion from emergency and portable generators, \npowered industrial vehicles (e.g., forklifts), temporary \nspace heaters, and other portable equipment (e.g., \nlandscaping equipment). \n• Propane, diesel, and gasoline usage data was collected \nfrom invoices and fuel reports obtained from third-party \nproviders. \n• Emission factors: U.S. EPA Emission Factors for \nGreenhouse Gas Inventories 2023. \nc. Emissions from refrigerant loss to the atmosphere: \n• Fugitive emissions from refrigeration, air conditioning, \nor similar equipment resulting from leakage and service \nover the operational life of the equipment. \n• Loss data was collected from invoices and vendor \nreports for refrigerant refills purchased and/or installed. \n• Emission factors from refrigerant loss: \nU.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas \nInventories 2023; United Kingdom (UK): UK database \npublished by the Department for Environment Food & \nRural Affairs (DEFRA) 2023; IPCC Fifth Assessment \nReport 2013. \nd. Fleet mobile combustion (diesel and gasoline): \n• Combustion from the operation of Tesla's on-road \nand non-road vehicles. \n• Diesel and gasoline usage (volume) was collected \nfrom fuel cards issued by Tesla's fleet management \npartner. Vehicle miles driven by Tesla on-road \nvehicles was collected from odometer readings and \nreal time telemetries on each vehicle. \n• Tesla classified vehicles by type: diesel medium and \nheavy-duty vehicles, gasoline passenger cars, \ngasoline light-duty trucks, gasoline heavy-duty \nvehicles, and non-road \n• industrial/commercial \nequipment. Temporary light \nduty fleet additions for operational use were \ncategorized as 'other', for which only CO2 emissions \nare calculated, because Tesla does not have detailed \ninformation on what type of vehicles were rented \nand miles driven. \n• CO2 emissions were calculated by multiplying the \nrelevant emission factor by the volume of diesel and \ngasoline used by Tesla's on-road and non-road \nvehicles for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n156",

Process emissions: \n• Lithium-ion battery cell recycling: \n• Emissions from processing manufacturing \nscrap lithium-ion cells at the Gigafactory \nNevada cell recycling site. \n• The concentration of CO2 and CH4 in emissions \n(emission rates) were measured during two \nemissions source tests. GHG emissions were \ncalculated by multiplying the quantity of \nmanufacturing scrap processed, as recorded \nby the recycling plant operations team, by the \nCO2 and CH4 emission rates developed based \non the emissions source tests. \n• Emission of CO2 resulting from cleaning plastic \nparts with liquid CO2: \n• CO2 emissions were assumed to equal the mass \nof liquid CO2 used in the cleaning process as \nmeasured by liquid CO2 sensors on the tank. \n• Combustion of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \nemitted to thermal oxidizers at manufacturing sites: \n• The quantity of VOCs emitted to thermal \noxidizers were estimated by calculating the \npotential to emit or by a continuous emissions \nmonitoring system. \n• The CO2 equivalent emissions were calculated \nusing the number of carbon atoms in the VOCs, \nthe molecular weight and the mass of the VOC \nexhausted to the thermal oxidizers and \nmultiplied by the destruction efficiency of the \nthermal oxidizer. \nf. Estimated emissions from the sources above account \nfor approximately 3.8% of Scope 1 GHG emissions. \ng.

This rate was then multiplied \nby the area of the site building space. \n• If cost data was available without the \nassociated usage, Tesla used local unit costs to \ncalculate usage. \n• District Heating usage data was collected from \ninvoices obtained from third-party \nproviders. \nIf usage data was not available, Tesla estimated the \nusage by extrapolating the average consumption \nfor the available months. If no data was reported, \nusage was based on sites in a similar geographic \nlocation and type of site. \n• The WRI and WBCSD issued additional guidance \nfor Scope 2 emissions in 2015 (in GHG Protocol \nScope 2 Guidance, An Amendment to the GHG \nProtocol Corporate Standard), which sets forth \nreporting under both location-based and \nmarket-based methodologies, where the prior \nversion of the GHG Protocol only addressed a \nlocation-based methodology. The location-\nbased method applies average emission factors \nthat correspond to the grid where the \nconsumption occurs, whereas the market-based \nmethod applies emission factors that correspond \nto energy purchased through contractual \ninstruments. Where contractual instruments \nwere not purchased, the market-based emission \nfactors represent either the residual mix, where \navailable, or the location grid-average factors. \nThis management assertion only includes Tesla's \nlocation-based Scope 2 GHG emissions as Tesla \nis continuing to implement its processes to \nmeasure and report its market-based Scope 2 \nGHG emissions. \n157",

    "text": "1 \nDear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners: \nFiscal year 2024 was a pivotal year for Microsoft. We entered our 50th year as a company and the second year of the AI \nplatform shift. With these milestones, I’ve found myself reflecting on how Microsoft has remained a consequential company \ndecade after decade in an industry with no franchise value. And I realize that it’s because—time and time again, when tech \nparadigms have shifted—we have seized the opportunity to reinvent ourselves to stay relevant to our customers, our \npartners, and our employees. And that’s what we are doing again today.  \nMicrosoft has been a platform and tools company from the start. We were founded in 1975 with a belief in creating \ntechnology that would enable others to create their own. And, nearly 50 years later, this belief remains at the heart of our \nmission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.  \nThis year, we moved from talking about AI to helping our customers translate it into real outcomes—one person, one \norganization, one institution, and one country at a time. We have made remarkable progress on this front across every \nindustry. For example:  \n• \nColes is generating 1.6 billion daily AI predictions across 850 Australian stores, ensuring every shopper finds \nwhat they need.  \n• \nUnilever is performing thousands of simulations with AI in the time it would take to run tens of laboratory \nexperiments, as it accelerates its product development.  \n• \nDevelopers at Itaú, Brazil’s largest private bank, are coding more efficiently using our AI pair programmer, \nGitHub Copilot.  \n• \nKhan Academy is making tutoring more accessible for students and helping teachers plan more creative \nlessons, using our small language model Phi.  \n• \nAquafarmers in Indonesia are improving their yields, thanks to an app built with the Azure OpenAI Service, as \nwell as Azure IoT.  \n• \nIn Kenya, street vendors now have access to credit for the first time, thanks to M-Kopa, a social enterprise \nusing Azure ML to do its forecasting.  \n• \nAnd enterprise customers and their employees around the world, from Amgen and Disney, to Finastra and \nVodafone, are using Microsoft 365 Copilot to become more creative and productive.  \nFinancially, the year was also marked by record performance. We delivered over $245 billion in annual revenue, up \n16 percent year-over-year, and over $109 billion in operating income, up 24 percent.  \nGoing forward, we are focused on three priorities: First, prioritizing fundamentals, with security above all else. We launched \nthe Secure Future Initiative (SFI) this year, bringing together every part of our organization to advance cybersecurity \nprotection. Second, driving trustworthy AI innovation across our entire portfolio while continuing to scale our cloud business. \nAnd, finally, managing our cost structure dynamically to generate durable, long-term operating leverage. All three priorities \nare critical to our ability to continue thriving as a company as we raise the bar on our operational excellence, with a focus \non continuous improvement across everything we do.  \nAGE OF AI  \nIf we go back 70 years to the beginning of modern computing, our industry has had two dreams: First, can computers \nunderstand us instead of us having to understand computers? And second, as we digitize more of the world—including \npeople, places, and things—can computers help us reason, plan, and act more effectively using all that information? Over \nthe past year, we have had breakthroughs on both fronts.  \nThe core underlying force behind these breakthroughs is scaling laws. Just like Moore’s Law drove the information \nrevolution, the scaling laws of deep neural networks (DNN) and transformers are driving today’s AI revolution. Up until the \nDNN inflection point, progress in compute was keeping up with Moore’s Law—doubling every two years. But we have now \nstarted to see progress in AI performance double roughly every six months.  \n  \nThere are three capabilities coming together because of these scaling laws. First, we have a new natural user interface that \nis multimodal. It supports speech, images, and videos—both as input and output. We have memory that retains important \ncontext, recalling both our personal knowledge and data across devices, apps, and the web. And, finally, we have new",

These agents will be able to work in \nconcert as a new input to help make small businesses more productive, make multinationals more competitive, make the \npublic sector more efficient, and improve health and education outcomes broadly.  \nMicrosoft has built three leading platforms to help our customers maximize their opportunity in this emerging agentic era: \nCopilot, which you can think of as the new UI for AI—the human interface for this agentic world; the Copilot stack, which \nbrings together infrastructure, data, and app services to help customers build their own copilots and agents for their own \nbusiness processes; and a new category of Copilot devices that are purpose-built for this new era, including the Copilot+ \nPCs we introduced this year.  \nOUR OPPORTUNITY  \nThe innovation we have driven over the past year matters only if we translate it into enduring value for our customers. That’s \nwhy, across our tech stack, we are focused on helping people and organizations realize the benefits of AI.  \nInfrastructure  \nThis year, we expanded our cloud and AI capacity, announcing new investments across five continents. These are long-\nterm assets to drive new growth for the next decade and beyond, and ensure communities around the world have access \nto the compute they need to drive economic growth in this new era.  \nOur cloud now also offers top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, \nincluding the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia, which we introduced last \nNovember.  \nMore broadly, we continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations as customers turn to Azure. Azure Arc is \nhelping customers streamline their transition, as they secure, develop, and operate workloads with Azure services \nanywhere. We have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90 percent year-over-year. And we remain the hyperscale cloud of choice \nfor SAP and Oracle workloads.  \nData & AI  \nAI models are now key building blocks for every application. And with Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the \nAI age, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers’ unique cost, latency, and design \nconsiderations. We offer leading frontier models, thanks to our strategic partnership with OpenAI. With Phi-3, which we \nannounced in April, we offer a family of powerful, small language models. And, with Models as a service, we provide API \naccess to third-party models, including the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. In total, we have over 60,000 Azure AI \ncustomers, up nearly 60 percent year-over-year. This year, we also announced a partnership with G42, which will run its AI \napplications and services on our cloud, as we collaborate to bring our latest AI technologies to the United Arab Emirates \nand other countries.  \nAI does not get created without data. At the data layer, we are fundamentally rethinking what it means to be an analytics \ndatabase or an operational data store in the world of AI. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the \nbroadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance—along with seamless \nintegration with all our AI services. And Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered, next-generation data platform we made generally \navailable this year, now has over 14,000 paid customers who can go from data, to insights, to action—all within the same \nunified SaaS solution.  \n  \nDigital & app innovation  \nFrom GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive developer tools. GitHub Copilot had a breakout year, as it \nbecame standard issue for developers in every industry. We now have more than 1.8 million paid subscribers and over \n77,000 enterprise customers, up 180 percent year-over-year. They are realizing productivity gains of up to 55 percent while",

This year, we also introduced Copilot Workspace, a Copilot-native \ndeveloper environment, which helps any developer go from idea, to code, to software—all in natural language.  \nWe are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, \nautomate workflows, or build a website. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up \n40 percent year-over-year.  \nModern work  \nMicrosoft 365 Copilot is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, transforming their work, workflow, and work artifacts. \nAdoption has been faster than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. And employees at nearly 60 percent of the Fortune 500 \nnow use Copilot to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. \nIn fact, internal and external studies show as much as a 70 percent improvement in productivity using generative AI for \nspecific work tasks. And early Microsoft 365 Copilot users were 29 percent faster in a series of general tasks like searching, \nwriting, and summarizing.  \nAnd we’re going further, bringing the Web plus Work plus Pages together as the new AI design system for knowledge work. \nWith Pages, which we just announced last month, you can take any information from the web or your work and turn it into \na multiplayer, AI-powered canvas. You can ideate with AI and then easily share what you create for collaboration with other \npeople.  \nAnd with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot with agents and build their own agents that proactively respond to \ndata and events from their own first- and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations have used it. And, just \nthis week, we announced new capabilities that will make it possible for customers to build autonomous agents using Copilot \nStudio.  \nMicrosoft Teams remains essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. \nThis year, we rolled out to all customers a new version that is up to two times faster while using 50 percent less memory. \nAnd Teams Premium surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400 percent year-over-year, as organizations chose it for \nadvanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation.  \nBusiness applications  \nWe’re using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications, too. Dynamics 365 once again took share, as \norganizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply chain functions.  \nAnd we are expanding our total addressable market by integrating Copilot into third-party systems as well. Our new \nDynamics 365 Contact Center infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow in a customer’s existing CRM.  \nWe are also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare. With DAX Copilot, more than 400 healthcare \norganizations are increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. On average, clinicians save more than five \nminutes per patient encounter. And 77 percent say it also improves documentation quality.  \n  \nSecurity  \nAs I mentioned earlier, security underpins every layer of our tech stack. We are doubling down on our Secure Future \nInitiative, as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. And we are focused \non making continuous progress across the six pillars of the initiative: protect tenants and isolate production systems; protect \nidentities and secrets; protect networks; protect engineering systems; monitor and detect threats; and accelerate response \nand remediation. As part of this commitment, all Microsoft employees now have security as a “core priority,” holding each \none of us accountable for building secure products and services.  \nWe are continuously applying what we are learning and translating it into security innovation for our customers. A great \nexample is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available this year. It brings together LLMs with domain-specific",

Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most AI-ready Windows PCs ever built. They include a new system \narchitecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. And we are working across \nour entire ecosystem to bring these to life, including with AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, along with our OEM partners.  \nProfessional social network  \nLinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. We surpassed 1 billion members for the \nfirst time this year, as we combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform how people learn, sell, and \nget hired. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the \nright message, to the right audience, on a safe and trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, \nPremium signups increased 51 percent, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI \ntools and skilling opportunities.  \nSearch, ads, and news  \nWith Copilot, we’re taking the first steps toward creating an AI companion, one that’s always by your side, helping you feel \nsmarter and more supported through natural conversations. The refreshed Copilot app we introduced earlier this month \ndelivers a more intuitive design with more digestible, speedy, and fluent answers. It now adapts to you with a warm tone \nand a distinct style, providing not only information but encouragement, feedback, and advice as you navigate life’s everyday \nchallenges—no matter how big or small. And we’re adding advanced capabilities like Voice and Vision that make it both \nmore useful and more natural.  \nWe also continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Microsoft Bing and \nEdge both took share again this year. And we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers \nand higher-quality image creation, and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers.  \nThousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And we are also \nhelping advertisers increase their ROI. Copilot in Microsoft Ad Platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot \nusing natural language.  \n  \nGaming  \nWe are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed \nOctober 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have \ngenerated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of \nWar. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—\nwhere, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation \nfor the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms.  \nOUR MISSION  \nAlthough we have made outstanding progress over the past year, we cannot take our permission to innovate—let alone \noperate—for granted. It is something we must earn.  \nWe always say Microsoft will do well only if the world around us does well. And that’s why we are focused on four enduring \ncommitments. They keep us grounded, serving as a guide as we make decisions, pushing us to ask critical questions to \nensure the technology we create benefits everyone on the planet, as well as the planet itself.",

    "text": "5 \nHow can we expand opportunity?  \nWe are democratizing access to AI and the skills needed to harness its potential, ensuring that every person, organization, \nand community can benefit from the opportunities AI brings.  \nThis year, we partnered with 375,000 nonprofits globally, providing $4.7 billion in donated and discounted technology—to \nhelp them build capacity, drive efficiencies, innovate, and increase their impact as they take on the world’s greatest \nchallenges. Together with our partners, we also made significant strides in skilling. We have trained and certified 14.1 million \npeople across 202 countries in digital skills as of June 2024. Over 80 percent of the learners were from groups furthest from \nopportunity in the digital economy.  \nAnd our work doesn’t stop there. We must do more to accelerate the equitable adoption of AI and narrow the digital divide. \nThat’s why we’ve launched new AI skilling initiatives in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry, and \ncivil society—to help millions of people learn to use generative AI, develop AI tools, and lead AI adoption. This includes \npeople from underserved communities, with a focus on young people, women, rural communities, and the Global South, as \nwell as employees of social impact organizations.  \nHow can we earn trust?  \nWe recognize that trust is earned, not given. And we remain committed to earning trust every day, spanning cybersecurity, \ntrustworthy AI, privacy, and digital safety.  \nOur Secure Future Initiative advances how we design, build, test, and operate our technology to ensure we deliver solutions \nthat meet the highest possible standard of security. Our first SFI Progress Report highlights updates spanning culture, \ngovernance, technology, and operations, but we recognize that our work on security is never complete. We must and will \ndo more. Our promise is to continually learn, improve, and adapt to the evolving needs of an increasingly complex security \nlandscape.  \nWe are focused on building AI that is trustworthy, meaning that it is secure, safe, and private. Our responsible AI practices, \ngrounded in our foundational AI principles, help ensure we do this from the beginning. And we’re building on this \ncommitment by introducing new product capabilities across our tech stack, ensuring that both our customers and developers \nare safeguarded at every level. Ultimately, these commitments and capabilities are key to fulfilling our mission. The world \nis looking to us to help defend and protect them, and we take that responsibility seriously.  \n  \nIn May, we published our first AI Transparency Report, which outlines how we build generative applications responsibly and \nsupport our customers. We also released Goals and Governance: Goals and Lessons for AI, which draws lessons from \nother globally governed technologies like civil aviation and nuclear power. Through our Accelerating Foundation Models \nResearch program, we’ve made grants to hundreds of projects in AI safety and alignment research, AI-driven scientific \ndiscovery, and beneficial applications of AI. And we launched our Global Perspectives Responsible AI Fellowship program, \ndesigned to center the voices of AI experts from the Global South and enable us to better understand AI’s impact on \ndeveloping countries.  \nAs we drive AI innovation, we continue to respond to a changing privacy landscape. We provide tools to help our customers \nprotect their privacy and control their data, and we have published several resources outlining our approach to privacy and \nAI for our consumer, commercial, and public sector customers.  \nFinally, we continue our work to create safe experiences online and protect customers from illegal and harmful content and \nconduct. To bolster our efforts to prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse risks, we have made new commitments to \nsafety by design in our AI services, joined the Tech Coalition’s Lantern Program, and proposed concrete actions that US \npolicymakers can take to protect the public through regulatory and policy measures.  \nHow can we protect fundamental rights?  \nWe are committed to protecting fundamental rights—extending the benefits of technology while mitigating its potential \nharms. For us, this means promoting responsible business practices, expanding connectivity and accessibility, protecting \ndemocracy, and advancing a fair and inclusive society.",

Going forward, \nwe’ll continue to respect global human rights and laws and take steps to mitigate the impact of our operations and our \ntechnology on the people in our value chain.  \nAs we build and deploy more AI solutions, connectivity and accessibility are foundational. Since 2017, we’ve extended \naccess to affordable high-speed internet to over 100 million people, including nearly 40 million in Africa. And we remain \nfocused on building inclusive, accessible AI that empowers people across the spectrum of disability.  \nMore than 4 billion people will vote this year in their respective elections, making it the biggest election year in history. At \nthe Munich Security Conference in February, we came together with others across the tech sector and pledged to help \nprevent deceptive AI content from interfering with global elections. As part of this pledge, we have worked to empower \ncampaigns, candidates, election officials, and voters to understand the risks of deceptive AI in elections and to take steps \nto protect themselves and democracies. To date, we’ve conducted deepfake trainings in over 20 countries. And our \ncorresponding public awareness campaign has reached over 355 million people.  \nLastly, we continued investing in both strategic national partnerships and community-based projects that leverage data and \ninsights to enable changes that advance racial equity and fairness in the criminal legal system.  \nHow can we advance sustainability?  \nFinally, we are on a journey to build a more sustainable future, from addressing our own environmental footprint to \nempowering our customers and the world with the technology needed to meet the climate challenge. Over the past year, \nwe have seen how AI can catalyze environmental progress in remarkable ways—from increasing the capacity of \ntransmission lines to deliver renewable power, to the discovery of new materials to support energy production and storage, \nto empowering the workforce with sustainability skills.  \nBut we also recognize the resource intensity of the infrastructure needed to yield these benefits, which is why we’re \nadvancing the sustainability of AI, from design to construction to operations, all while working to improve the efficiency of \nthese technologies. We’re also investing in innovation through Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund and our AI for Good \nLab, advancing research and advocating for policies that can drive global impact.  \n  \nIn our latest Environmental Sustainability Report, we shared progress toward our 2030 commitments. We’re on track in \nseveral areas. Where we’re not yet on track, we’re mobilizing to accelerate our progress toward becoming carbon negative, \nwater positive, and zero waste, as well as to protect and preserve ecosystems.  \nWhen it comes to our carbon footprint, we continue to support clean electricity infrastructure through long-term investments \nto bring more power onto the grids where we operate. Since setting our carbon negative target, we have contracted over \n34 gigawatts of renewable energy, including projects in 24 countries.  \nIn our efforts to become water positive, we provided more than 1.5 million people with access to clean water and sanitation, \nachieving our water access target.  \nOur journey to zero waste includes reducing waste at our campuses and datacenters and advancing circularity for cloud \nhardware, packaging, and devices. Our most recent report showed we had a reuse and recycle rate of 89.4 percent for \nservers and components across all cloud hardware.  \nFinally, AI gives new opportunity for ecosystem and biodiversity management with solutions like AI-assisted bioacoustics. \nAnd we’re expanding collaboration with local communities to build and operate datacenters in ways that address local \nchallenges and create greater benefits. This work is guided by our Sustainability Standards for new construction and our \nDatacenter Community Pledge.  \nLearn more about our progress and learnings as we pursue our commitments in our annual Impact Summary.  \nOUR CULTURE  \nJust as our culture has been critical in getting us to this point, it will be critical to our success going forward.

For us, that means \nconstantly exercising our growth mindset and confronting our fixed mindset—each one of us, every day. It is the only way \nwe will succeed.  \nOur growth mindset culture helps us in our continuous pursuit of high performance. It doesn’t matter what we said about \nour culture 10 years ago or even last year if we aren’t practicing it today—by anticipating the unmet and unarticulated needs \nof customers; by working together as One Microsoft to deliver the best end-to-end solutions and services; and by actively \nseeking diversity and embracing inclusion—to ensure our workforce represents the planet we serve and the products we \nbuild always meet our customers’ needs. In our latest Diversity & Inclusion Report, we share the ways our longstanding \ncommitment to diversity and inclusion endures, and what we’re learning as we continue to hire, develop, and grow a global \nworkforce that best supports each other and our customers. This is how we thrive—as individuals, as teams, and as an \norganization. And, when we thrive, we can help our customers and the world thrive too.  \nGiving also remains core to our culture.

He was able to apply for complex \ngovernment farm subsidies using just his voice, thanks to an app built with GPT 3.5. It was remarkable. A frontier model \ndeveloped on the West Coast of the US just months earlier was being used to directly improve the lives of rural farmers on \nthe other side of the globe.  \n  \nThat rate of diffusion was unlike anything I had seen in my career. And the pace has only increased. Earlier this year, I was \nin Thailand, where I met developers using Phi-3 to optimize their operations just days after the small language model was \nreleased.  \nTo me, that represents the true democratization of expertise. Where the internet era put information at our fingertips, AI is \nputting expertise at our fingertips. Impact like this is why we are in this industry, and it is what gives all of us at Microsoft \ndeep meaning in our work.  \nIt is why we are investing in our fundamentals, in our people, and in continued innovation—so that we can help others \nachieve more for the long term.  \nIt is not an exaggeration to say that what each of us does right now with the unique opportunity we have been given will \nshape the future. And I look forward to seeing how all of us use Microsoft as a platform to make a difference—one customer, \none community, one country at a time.  \n  \n  \n \nSatya Nadella  \nChairman and Chief Executive Officer  \nOctober 18, 2024",

We continue to develop complete, intelligent \nsolutions for our customers that empower people to be productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and \nsimplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which \nwe expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:  \n• \nTransforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and \nimprove how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, and interact with one another.  \n• \nBuilding and running cloud-based services in ways that utilize ubiquitous computing to unleash new \nexperiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.  \n• \nApplying AI and ambient intelligence to drive insights, revolutionize many types of work and business \nprocesses, and provide substantive productivity gains using natural methods of communication.  \n• \nTackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, \nidentity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.  \n• \nInventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any \ndevices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming.  \n• \nUsing Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement \nwith our services like Microsoft Edge, Bing, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Consumer, Xbox Game Pass, and \nmore.  \nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales \nmotions.  \nCorporate Social Responsibility  \nCommitment to Sustainability  \nMicrosoft’s approach to addressing climate change starts with the sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we committed \nto being a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030.  \nSince announcing that commitment, we have seen major changes both in the technology sector and in our understanding \nof what it will take to meet our climate goals. New technologies, including generative AI, hold promise for new innovations \nthat can help address the climate crisis. At the same time, the infrastructure and electricity needed for these technologies \ncreate new challenges for meeting sustainability commitments across the tech sector.  \nIn May 2024, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked back at our progress in several areas \nduring fiscal year 2023. In four areas we are on track, and in each of these we see progress that has the potential to have \nglobal impact beyond our own sustainability work. These are:  \n• \nReducing our direct operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2).  \n• \nAccelerating carbon removal.  \n  \n• \nDesigning for circularity to minimize waste and reusing cloud hardware.  \n• \nImproving biodiversity and protecting more land than we use.  \nAt the same time, there are two areas where we’re not yet on track, and in each of these we are intensively engaged in \nwork to identify and pursue additional breakthroughs. These are:  \n• \nReducing our indirect emissions (Scope 3).  \n• \nReducing our water use and replenishing more water than we consume in our datacenter operations.  \nEven amid the challenges, we remain optimistic. We’re encouraged by ongoing progress across our campuses and \ndatacenters, and throughout our value chain.",

    "text": "14 \nAddressing Racial Injustice and Inequity  \nIn June 2020, we outlined a series of multi-year commitments designed to address the racial injustice and inequity \nexperienced by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, including Black and African American communities. We \nremain committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in \nemployees’ communities, and beyond.  \nIn fiscal year 2024, we continued to collaborate with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to advance \nprojects and programs. We grew our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American Communities program, to \nhelp more than 3,000 local organizations in nearly 1,900 Black and African American communities use technical solutions \nto modernize and streamline operations. We also expanded our Technology Education and Learning Support (“TEALS”) \nprogram to reach nearly 550 high schools across 21 racial equity expansion regions with the support of nearly 1,500 \nvolunteers, 12% of whom identify as Black or African American.  \nWe have committed $150 million in Minority Depository Institutions and funds supporting Black and African American-owned \nsmall businesses. These commitments drive sustained impact by directly enabling an increase of funds into local \ncommunities, improving diverse, small-business access to capital, and increasing skill development. We continue to partner \nwith diverse-owned banking partners and asset managers to catalyze growth and industry participation. Additionally, we \nenriched our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black- and African \nAmerican-owned suppliers. We have also provided 162 low- or no-interest loans to our small to medium-sized partners \nthrough our Partner Capital Fund.  \nWe also continue to make progress toward our overall commitment to double the number of Black and African American \nand Hispanic and Latinx leaders in the U.S. by 2025.  \nInvesting in Digital Skills  \nMicrosoft’s Skills for Jobs initiative aims to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible \nlearning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. This initiative brings together classes, Career \nEssentials Certificates, and other resources from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn \nfrom LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. Our goal was to train and certify 10 million learners by 2025. As of May 2024, we have \nsurpassed that goal, training and certifying 12.6 million learners. We also launched a campaign in the United States in 2021 \nto help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the nation’s cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the country’s \nworkforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation’s higher education \ninstitutions, providing training for new and existing faculty, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 \nstudents. The cyber skills initiative has expanded to 27 additional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks coupled \nwith significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, where we’ve partnered with nonprofits and other educational \ninstitutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.  \n  \nGenerative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if everyone has the skills to use \nit. In June 2023, we launched an AI Skills initiative to help everyone learn how to harness the power of AI. This includes a \nnew LinkedIn learning pathway offering new coursework on learning the foundations of generative AI. We also launched a \nnew global grant challenge to uncover new ways of training workers on generative AI and provide greater access to digital \nlearning events and resources. Additionally, we extended our reach in rural communities, including through our TechSpark \ninitiative in the United States. As of June 2024, we’ve helped more than 2.5 million people in 92% of the world’s countries \nlearn how to use AI.  \nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  \nMicrosoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our \nsuccess, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive and do their best work. We strive to maximize the \npotential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables \nour global employees to create products and services that further our mission. Microsoft’s culture is grounded in growth \nmindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow, operating as one company instead of multiple \nsiloed businesses. Our culture also embeds the security of customers and Microsoft as a priority for every employee and \nacross all of our organizations.",

Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product \nroadmap, and expanding into new categories.  \nGaming  \nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, \nand cloud services. Our game content is developed through a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and \ndifferentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual \nproperty roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game \nPass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 400 first- and third-party console \nand PC titles.  \nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a \nvariety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, \nads, and digital stores. We’ve seen new devices from third-party manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end points \nthat help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them.

Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified \napplications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer \nbase. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. \nGrowth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of \ngames, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to \naccess our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences.  \n  \nSearch and News Advertising  \nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global \naudience. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Copilot are key tools to enable user acquisition and \nengagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to first-\nparty tools, we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize search \nofferings.

We believe \nWindows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and \ncompatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.  \nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of \nhigh-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which \nare also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.  \nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming \nservices, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of \nentertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from \nNintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively \npositioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in \nhardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong \ncontent from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.  \nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google, OpenAI, and a wide array of websites, social platforms \nlike Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.  \nOPERATIONS  \nWe have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order processing, \nbilling, credit and collections, customer lifecycle operations, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. \nThe centers in Ireland and Romania support the African, European, and Middle East regions; the centers in India and Ireland \nsupport the Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Arlington, Virginia, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina, Fargo, \nNorth Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Redmond, Washington, Reno, Nevada, and San Jose, Costa Rica support the \nAmericas regions.  \nIn addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions.

This engineering group includes \nMicrosoft Research, one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations, which focuses on fundamental \nresearch in AI, computer science, and a broad range of other disciplines.  \n• \nLinkedIn – focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs and \nthe way businesses hire, market, sell, and learn.  \n• \nGaming – focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help \ngrow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.  \nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer \ntechnical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and \nenhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as \npossible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before \nreleasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application \nvendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product \ndocumentation internally.  \nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to \nensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware \nproducts, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and \ncurrently have a portfolio of over 63,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 23,000 pending worldwide. While \nwe employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we also engage in outbound \nlicensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into \nbroader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also \npurchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual \nproperty broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, \nadvancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external \ndevelopment community. Our engagement with open source software also causes us to license our intellectual property \nrights broadly in certain situations.  \nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, \nwe believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially \nreasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single \nlicense or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.",

Based on our assessment of key \ntechnology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of \ntechnologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating \nsystems.  \nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research \nand development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive \nin local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.  \nWe plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and \nas appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across \nthe company. This includes continuing to support fundamental research, which provides us with a unique perspective on \nfuture trends and contributes to our innovation. \nDISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING  \nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and \nresellers. Our sales organization performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and \npublic-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; \nmanaging OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who \nengage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.  \nOEMs  \nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. \nThe largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell \ndevices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to \nsubscribe to Microsoft 365 Consumer.  \nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is \nmanaged through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or \nmore of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many \nregional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC \nmanufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft \ndistributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.  \nDirect  \nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and \nEnterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, \nand partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” \nor “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to \nthose offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.  \nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and \ngaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to \nfacilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.  \n  \nDistributors and Resellers  \nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”), \ndistributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations \nof all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically",

Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses \nand SA is included.  \nSelect Plus  \nA Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any \naffiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses \nand SA is optional.  \nPartner Programs  \nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in \ncombination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller \npartner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and \nsupport their customer subscriptions.  \nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors \nwho want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide hosted applications and software services to their end \ncustomers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on units licensed.  \nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications \nand then license the unified business solution to their end users.  \nCUSTOMERS  \nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector \ninstitutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly \nupon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.  \nGOVERNMENT REGULATION  \nWe are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that \nmay apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, \ntelecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. How these laws and regulations apply to \nour business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to \njurisdiction. To comply with the accelerating global regulatory obligations, we established a regulatory governance \nframework and to create a repeatable system-focused approach to regulatory governance with an initial focus on four \ndomains: Responsible AI, Privacy, Digital Safety, and Cybersecurity. The framework is designed to help us maintain \ncustomer trust and confidence in our products, remain in compliance with regulators around the globe, and effectively scale \nour capability to address the growing number of complex regulations. Through the framework, our legal and regulatory \nsubject matter experts ingest regulations, develop standards and implementation guidance, and, when appropriate, work \nwith our engineers to develop and implement products to monitor compliance. Our business teams, with legal support, \nmanage the compliance programs and prepare external regulatory and commercial reporting, and our internal audit teams \nconduct reviews of our programs and processes. While we intended to create a unified approach to regulatory compliance, \nsome of the programs and processes established pursuant to the framework are tailored to meet specific regulatory",

MD&A is \nprovided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the \naccompanying Notes to Financial Statements. This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year \nended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. For a discussion of the year ended June 30, 2023 \ncompared to the year ended June 30, 2022, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023.  \nOVERVIEW  \nMicrosoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) available broadly \nand doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. \nWe create platforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our \ncustomers.  \nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and \nbusinesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global \naudience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; \nsupporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, \nand selling our other products and services; and income taxes.  \nHighlights from fiscal year 2024 compared with fiscal year 2023 included:  \n• \nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 23% to $137.4 billion.  \n• \nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% driven by Office 365 Commercial \ngrowth of 16%.  \n• \nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 4% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers \ngrew to 82.5 million.  \n• \nLinkedIn revenue increased 9%.  \n• \nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.  \n• \nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 22% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth \nof 30%.  \n• \nWindows revenue increased 8% with Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) \nrevenue growth of 7% and Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth of 11%.  \n• \nDevices revenue decreased 15%.  \n• \nXbox content and services revenue increased 50% driven by 44 points of net impact from the Activision Blizzard \nInc. (“Activision Blizzard”) acquisition. The net impact reflects the change of Activision Blizzard content from \nthird-party to first-party.  \n• \nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 12%.  \nOn October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a total purchase price of $75.4 billion, \nconsisting primarily of cash. The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated financial \nstatements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment. \nRefer to Note 8 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.",

Each \nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the \nindustry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and \ndevelopment activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, \nand competitive forces.  \nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks  \nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are \ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. \nThe devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in \nsome cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, \nand devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue \nto evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.  \nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and \nmay decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations \nand increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for \nAI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking \nsupplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily \nmanufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other \nmanufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products \ncontain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could \nimpact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.  \nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and \nindustry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, \nbroad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, \nand competitive compensation and benefits.  \nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and \nexpenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may \nsignificantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have \na material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2024.  \nRefer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.  \nSeasonality  \nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is \ndriven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.  \nChange in Accounting Estimate  \nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in \nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.",

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of \nderivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  \n  \nFiscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023  \nInterest and dividends income increased due to higher yields. Interest expense increased due to the issuance of commercial \npaper. Net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher equity impairments and lower gains on \nequity investments. Net losses on derivatives decreased primarily due to lower losses on equity derivatives. Other, net \nprimarily reflects net recognized losses on equity method investments.  \nINCOME TAXES  \nEffective Tax Rate  \nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate \nwas primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice \n2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter \nof fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice \n2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit \nregulations indefinitely.  \nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign \njurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations \ncenter in Ireland.  \nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result \nof the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income \nbefore income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023, \nour U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.  \nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published its model rules “Tax Challenges Arising \nFrom the Digitalisation of the Economy – Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)” which established a global \nminimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries have implemented or are in the \nprocess of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do \nnot currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as \ncountries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional guidance.",

    "text": "35 \nUncertain Tax Positions  \nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on \nSeptember 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the \nNOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion \nplus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We \ndisagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals \noffice and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. \nBased on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax \ncontingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.  \nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to \nexamination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of \neach of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  \nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  \nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-\nGAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment \ncharges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. We believe \nthese non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify \ntrends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction \nwith GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should \nnot be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  \nThe following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:  \n  \n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) \n2024\n2023 \nPercentage\nChange\nGross margin \n$ \n171,008 $ \n146,052   \n17% \nSeverance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs \n \n0  \n152   \n* \n  \nAdjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) \n$ \n 171,008 $   146,204   \n17% \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nOperating income \n$ \n109,433 $ \n88,523   \n24% \nSeverance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs \n \n0  \n1,171   \n* \n  \nAdjusted operating income (non-GAAP) \n$ \n109,433 $ \n89,694   \n22% \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nNet income \n$ \n88,136 $ \n72,361   \n22% \nSeverance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs \n \n0  \n946   \n* \n  \nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) \n$ \n88,136 $ \n73,307   \n20% \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nDiluted earnings per share \n$ \n11.80 $ \n9.68   \n22% \nSeverance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs \n \n0  \n0.13   \n* \n  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) \n$ \n11.80 $ \n9.81   \n20% \n \n  \n* \nNot meaningful.  \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital \nmarkets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing \nactivities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related \nto the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

    "text": "36 \nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments  \nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $75.5 billion and $111.3 billion as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively. Equity and other investments were $14.6 billion and $9.9 billion as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nOur short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly \nof highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The \ninvestments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities \nto diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average \nmaturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income \nindices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are \nprimarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  \nValuation  \nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the \nfair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government \nsecurities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \nare not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the \nquoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, \nsuch as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-\ndeveloped models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using \nunobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  \nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these \nvendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying \nsignificant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by \nour pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. \nOur broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments \nbased on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a \nsufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair \nvalue processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include \nmodel validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of \nprices where appropriate.  \nCash Flows  \nCash from operations increased $31.0 billion to $118.5 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to an increase in cash \nreceived from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $6.2 billion to $37.8 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due \nto a $5.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $3.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net \nof repayments, offset in part by a $2.0 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $74.3 billion to \n$97.0 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $67.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of \ncash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets and a $16.4 billion increase in additions to property and \nequipment.  \nDebt Proceeds  \nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The \nproceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, \nfunding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. \nRefer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.  \nUnearned Revenue  \nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software \nAssurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract \nperiod for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes",

We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our \nBoard of Directors. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.  \nOther Planned Uses of Capital  \nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of \ntechnology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, \nincluding new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, \nand administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings \nand our investments in AI infrastructure and training. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate \noffices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged \nin any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to \nmaterially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  \nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  \nRefer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.  \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  \nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing \nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a \nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \nWe have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, \nresearch and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and business combinations – valuation of \nintangible assets.  \nRevenue Recognition  \nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining \nwhether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \nversus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses \nand cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted \nfor separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud \nservices, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the \ndesktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from \nOffice 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  \nJudgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. We use a \nsingle amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software \nupdates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products \nand services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the \nvarious products and services.",

    "text": "39 \nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers \nand circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in \ndetermining the SSP.  \nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \ndetermining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \nconsideration were not material for the periods presented.  \n  \nImpairment of Investment Securities  \nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, \nwe evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to \nwhich the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ \na systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment \nof our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business \noutlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the \nsecurity before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income \n(expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions \ndeteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  \nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment \nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a \nqualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the \namount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other \nincome (expense), net.  \nGoodwill  \nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We \nevaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation \napproach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating \nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would \nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could \ninclude a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or \ndisposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  \nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of \nassets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each \nreporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow \nmethodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on \ninternal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash \nflows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  \nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, \nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination \nof fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.",

    "text": "40 \nResearch and Development Costs  \nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until \ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs \nare capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when \ntechnological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software \nproducts is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this \noccurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue \nover the estimated life of the products.  \n  \nLegal and Other Contingencies    \nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss \nfrom a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset \nhas been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining \nwhether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome \nand the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our \nconsolidated financial statements.  \nIncome Taxes  \nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current \nyear, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an \nentity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely \nthan not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the \nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest \nbenefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides \nguidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, \naccounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in \nassessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax \nreturns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial \nstatements.  \nBusiness Combinations – Valuation of Intangible Assets  \nAccounting for business combinations requires significant judgments when allocating the purchase price to the estimated \nfair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Determination of fair value involves estimates \nand assumptions which can be complex, most notably with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates used in the \nvaluation of intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected cash flows, useful lives, and \ndiscount rates. While management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, \nthese assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward-looking views of our business and market conditions. \nThe judgments made in this valuation process could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.",

    "text": "48 \nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES  \nAccounting Principles  \nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles \ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  \nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period \namounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows \nstatements.  \nPrinciples of Consolidation  \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany \ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.  \nEstimates and Assumptions  \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts \nof assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, \ndetermining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price \n(“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss \ncontingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our \nreporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the \nmarket value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility \nis achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated \nfinancial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results \nand outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.  \nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in \nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.  \nForeign Currencies  \nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue \nand expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting \nfrom this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.  \nRevenue  \nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue  \nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server \napplications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video \ngames, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related \naccessories.  \nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, \nplatforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting services. \nService and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.",

    "text": "49 \nRevenue Recognition  \nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects \nthe consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include \nvarious combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate \nperformance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, \nwhich are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  \nNature of Products and Services  \nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available \nto the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the \nsame functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from \ndistinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. \nIn cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional \ncharge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related \ndevice or license.  \nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software \nAssurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, \ntools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct \nperformance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract \nperiod as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance \nobligations that are satisfied over time.  \nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the \nsoftware, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \nsubscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \nconsumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such \nresources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the \nindividual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are \nprovided.  \nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action \nnecessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are \nprovided.  \nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function \nwithout the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance \nobligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end \ncustomers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  \nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant \nproduct and service offering.  \nSignificant Judgments  \nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining \nwhether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \nversus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses \nand cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted \nfor separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud \nservices, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the \ndesktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from \nOffice 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  \n  \nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate \nSSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no",

We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately \nand need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and \nservices.  \nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers \nand circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in \ndetermining the SSP.  \nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \ndetermining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \nconsideration were not material for the periods presented.  \nContract Balances and Other Receivables  \nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue \nis recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year \nagreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a \nreceivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice \nand receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  \nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and \ncloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year \nagreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting \nservices to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-\ndelivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the \nrevenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  \nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in \nunearned revenue during the period.  \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 \nto 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing \nfrom our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription \nterm with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced \nannually with revenue recognized upfront.  \nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.9 billion and \n$4.5 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  \nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable \nbalance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently \navailable evidence.",

Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in \nother current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  \nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the \namortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation \nprogram and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with \nannual sales activities.  \nCost of Revenue  \nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs \nrelated to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold \nby original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs \nincurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and \nroyalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the \namortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the \nestimated lives of the products.  \n  \nProduct Warranty  \nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related \nrevenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure \nrates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware \nwarranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally",

For software warranties, we estimate \nthe costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our \nestimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \nResearch and Development  \nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other \nheadcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-\nparty development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such \ncosts related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological \nfeasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. \nOnce technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated \nlives of the products.  \nSales and Marketing  \nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other \nheadcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade \nshows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.7 billion, \n$904 million, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  \nStock-Based Compensation  \nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), \nis measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related \nservice or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the \ngrant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value \nof PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method \nand for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.  \nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is \nentitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  \nIncome Taxes  \nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. \nCertain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of \nsuch temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation \nallowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as \nlong-term in our consolidated balance sheets.  \nFinancial Instruments  \nInvestments  \nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to \nbe cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with \noriginal maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term \ninvestments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature \nand because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  \nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific \nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive \nincome. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by \nmanagement. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market \nconditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost.

In \naddition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If \nwe have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, \nthen a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost \nbasis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future \nimpairments.  \nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily \ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable \nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a \nperiodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than \ncarrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  \nInvestments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the primary \nbeneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we have (1) the \npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb \nlosses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We have determined we \nare not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments are not consolidated and the \nmajority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  \nDerivatives  \nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes \nin the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  \nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), \nnet with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from \nthe assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  \nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other \ncomprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. \nGains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other \nincome (expense), net.  \nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily \nrecognized in other income (expense), net.  \nFair Value Measurements  \nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the \nextent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value \nmeasurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement \nin its entirety. These levels are:  \n• \nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our \nLevel 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our \nLevel 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.  \n  \n• \nLevel 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the \nBlack-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by \nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models \nproject future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable \ninputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for \ncurrencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, \nforeign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal \nsecurities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-\ncounter forward, option, and swap contracts.",

    "text": "54 \n• \nLevel 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that \nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using \nmodel-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets \nand liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and \nintangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used \nin the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.  \nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these \ninvestments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted \nmarket prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  \nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.  \nInventories  \nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, \nand manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated \nselling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on \nhand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a \nreduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \nProperty and Equipment  \nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method \nover the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and \nequipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer \nequipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and \nfurniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.  \nLeases  \nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use \n(“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases \nare included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance \nsheets.  \nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation \nto make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at \ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not \nprovide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for \ncollateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset \nalso includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or \nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is \nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  \nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain \nequipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \nAdditionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU \nassets and liabilities.  \nGoodwill  \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) \non an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely \nthan not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.",

We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events \nor circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  \nRelated Party Transactions  \nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection AI, Inc. (“Inflection”), pursuant to which we obtained a non-\nexclusive license to Inflection’s intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors, is a co-founder of \nand serves on the board of directors of Inflection.

The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim \nconsolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The \nstandard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and interim periods thereafter, with \nearly adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our segment disclosures.  \nIncome Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures  \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure \nof disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate \nreconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our \nannual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted.

    "text": "60 \nForeign Currencies  \nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency \nexposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.  \nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange \nforward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-\ndenominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging \ninstruments.  \nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign \nexchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  \nInterest Rate  \nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value \nhedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.  \nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage \nthe average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-\nincome indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and \nare included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.  \nEquity  \nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, \nand swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.  \nCredit  \nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap \ncontracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These \ncontracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.  \nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features  \nCertain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-\nterm unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of \n$1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard \nconvention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2024, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and \ncash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.",

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net \nincome tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions \nresulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, \nand tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our foreign regional operating center \nin Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 83% and 81% of our foreign income before tax. In \nfiscal year 2022, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the \nU.S. rate, generated 71% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and \nGILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2024, includes tax benefits from tax law changes. In fiscal year 2024, tax benefits from tax law \nchanges primarily relates to the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) \nand U.S. Treasury Department.

In fiscal years 2024, 2023, \nand 2022, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.  \nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to tax benefits \nfrom tax law changes, including the delay of the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations. The increase in our \neffective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit \nin the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating \nto stock-based compensation.",

    "text": "74 \nNOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES  \nU.S. Cell Phone Litigation  \nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a \ndefendant in 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio \nemissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility \nfor these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the \nNokia defendants. Twelve of these cases were consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are \nstayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims \narising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency \nemission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either \noperated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also \nallege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  \nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on \nthe basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion \nto exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia \nCourt of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals \nissued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further \nproceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by \nthe court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ \nmotion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of \nplaintiffs’ experts from testifying. The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal of the consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to \nappeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed the court’s order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their \nbriefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the stayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, the court \nentered summary judgment in nine of the stayed cases on the grounds that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by the general \ncausation outcome in the consolidated cases.  \nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter  \nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether \nLinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection \nRegulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with \na non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. In July 2024, the IDPC provided \nLinkedIn with a revised non-public draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision, at which \ntime Microsoft will consider its options to appeal.  \nOther Contingencies  \nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. \nAlthough management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a \nmaterial adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and \nmanagement’s view of these matters may change in the future.  \nAs of June 30, 2024, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $641 million. While we intend to defend these matters \nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded \namounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material \nadverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.",

Operating expenses that \nare allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit \nand are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.  \nIn addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs generally \ninclude legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, \nshared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each \nallocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally \nbased on relative gross margin or relative headcount.  \nSegment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:  \n  \n(In millions) \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nYear Ended June 30, \n2024 \n2023\n2022\n \n \n \n \nRevenue \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nProductivity and Business Processes \n$ \n77,728  $ \n69,274 $ \n63,364 \nIntelligent Cloud \n \n105,362   \n87,907  \n74,965 \nMore Personal Computing \n \n62,032   \n54,734  \n59,941 \nTotal \n$ \n 245,122  $  211,915 $  198,270 \n \n \nOperating Income \n \n \n \n \nProductivity and Business Processes \n$ \n40,540  $ \n34,189 $ \n29,690 \nIntelligent Cloud \n \n49,584   \n37,884  \n33,203 \nMore Personal Computing \n \n19,309   \n16,450  \n20,490 \nTotal \n$ \n109,433  $ \n88,523 $ \n83,383",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the \nfinancial position of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each \nof the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the \nUnited States of America.  \nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting.  \nBasis for Opinion  \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion \non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB \nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and \nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform \nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether \ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also \nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating \nthe overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  \nCritical Audit Matters  \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements \nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex \njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, \ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the \ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.  \nRevenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements  \nCritical Audit Matter Description  \nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that \nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers \ncustomers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its \ncustomer agreements through its volume licensing programs.",

    "text": "82 \nSignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, and \nincludes the following:  \n• \nDetermination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be \naccounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based \nservices.  \n• \nThe pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.  \n• \nIdentification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., \nvariable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).  \n• \nDetermination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that \nare not sold separately.  \nGiven these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments \nin determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor \njudgment.  \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  \nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for certain customer agreements included the \nfollowing:  \n• \nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination \nof the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.  \n• \nWe evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements for \nreasonableness.  \n• \nWe selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:  \n- \nObtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents \nthat were part of the agreement.  \n- \nTested management’s identification and treatment of contract terms.  \n- \nAssessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of \ntheir accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.  \n• \nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services \nthat are not sold separately.  \n• \nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue \nrecognized in the financial statements.  \nIncome Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements  \nCritical Audit Matter Description  \nThe Company’s long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain \nunresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for \ntax years subsequent to 2003. In the current fiscal year, the Company received Notices of Proposed Adjustments (“NOPAs”) \nfor the tax years 2004 to 2013, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing. While the Company has settled a portion \nof the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.  \nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment \nand include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit \nsettlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of certain transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with \nthe IRS, evaluating management’s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive \naudit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.",

The Company accounted for the \nActivision Blizzard, Inc., acquisition as a business combination and, accordingly, allocated the purchase price to the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Identifiable \nintangible assets acquired included marketing-related intangible assets, technology-based intangible assets, and customer-\nrelated intangible assets. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and \nliabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill.  \nWe identified the fair value determination of certain marketing-related and technology-based intangible assets for the \nbusiness combination as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment required in determining their estimated fair \nvalues. Management’s estimates of fair value included assumptions for revenue and expense forecasts and the selection \nof appropriate discount rates. There was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying audit procedures \nand evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates, including involvement of our fair value specialists.  \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  \nOur audit procedures related to management’s estimates of the fair value of certain marketing-related and technology-\nbased intangible assets acquired included the following, among others:  \n• \nWe tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the business combination, including internal controls \nover the revenue and expense forecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates.  \n• \nWe assessed the knowledge, skills, abilities, and objectivity of management’s valuation specialist and evaluated the \nwork performed.  \n  \n• \nWhen assessing the reasonableness of assumptions related to forecasted revenue and expenses, we evaluated \nwhether the assumptions used were reasonable considering historical financial information of Activision Blizzard, Inc., \nand the Company’s forecasted financial information.  \n• \nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:  \n- \nTesting the source information underlying the discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.",

Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \nour financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United \nStates of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately \nand fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for \npreparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of \ncompany assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that \nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated \nfinancial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control \nover financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial \nstatements would be prevented or detected.  \nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the \nframework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission.

Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial \nreporting was effective as of June 30, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during \nthe quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal \ncontrol over financial reporting.

We overhauled systems \nto increase manager accountability, evolved our products to \nwork better for more people, and expanded programs to unlock \nnew economic opportunities for underrepresented communities \naround the world. And most importantly, we took steps to \nfurther embed these efforts into Google’s fabric, operationally \nand culturally.\nThe past year brought global challenges that tested us. But our \nfocus didn’t waver, it sharpened. We stood firm on our Racial \nEquity Commitments (about.google/commitments/racialequity) \nand continued driving work that championed belonging, in all its \nforms, across the company.\nWe think of our efforts across three broad categories: Workplace, \nProducts, and Society. These are the places where we work to \ncultivate belonging, and where our actions take root. This report \ndetails those actions, while also highlighting where we must \ncontinue to grow. Because in the ten years we’ve been sharing \nour progress, we’ve come to understand this: Building for all \nbuilds us all.\nAs we work toward a future centered on equity and respect – a \nfuture where everyone can belong – we still have much to learn \nand much to do.
